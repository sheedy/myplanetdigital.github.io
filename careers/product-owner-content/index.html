<p>Toronto</p>
<h3 id="about-the-position">About the position</h3>
<p>You’re the person our client sees - the face of Myplanet. Setting the vision for each product or project, our product owners then drive the daily development of our applications for prominent government, enterprise and not-for-profit customers. You will be working with a cross-functional team of developers, designers, and a Scrummaster (team coach / development co-ordinator) to deliver on-time and on-budget. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the product vision and manage stakeholders to that goal</li>
<li>Manages and prioritizes design and development backlog</li>
<li>Release plan, sprint plan, and backlog grooming</li>
<li>Represent the team to stakeholder groups</li>
<li>Clear communication of product budget with team</li>
<li>Consultation on proposals and sales process</li>
<li>Business value assessment</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="about-you">About you</h3>
<p>You have some background in project management or product ownership. You know how to set a vision among our team and client, then stay laser focused on our end goal. Bonus points if you have work experience under an agile project management methodology.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You can talk.</strong> You work directly with our clients, so you’re quick on your feet in discussion and can manage multiple stakeholders. You need to communicate effectively both in person and in writing.</li>
<li><strong>You can listen.</strong> We run on SCRUM, so almost all of our work is team-based. We don’t believe in authoritarian rule, so you need to understand how to balance the interests of your team with the client’s needs.</li>
<li><strong>You’re agile.</strong>  Sort of like a Cheetah, but more so like being a member of a self-organizing, well-oiled, cross-functional team. You believe in quick iterations, and have the ability to pitch in wherever your help is needed.</li>
<li><strong>You’re #1 at something.</strong> Show us you know how to be great, whether it’s as a cyclist or professional hacky-sack enthusiast.</li>
<li><strong>You get stuff done.</strong> Cut through internal politics. You would rather just do it than debate it, then get feedback from end users to make it better.</li>
<li><strong>You’re intense.</strong> You don’t stop until you get what you want. You have “the look”, described by some as “fire in the eyes” and by the less-informed as “bats#%t crazy”.</li>
<li><strong>You’re crazy (like a fox!).</strong> If we do the same things as everyone else, we’ll get mediocre results. This position requires you to question every idea, test every assumption, and pivot as we see where the true opportunities lie.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#39;re a startup guy/gal, you&#39;ll learn a lot just by being in our environment. You&#39;ll collide with amazingly smart developers, designers, analysts, and business folk - all of whom are constantly formulating new business models and thinking radical thoughts about the future.</p>
<h3 id="about-us">About us</h3>
<p>Myplanet is a rapidly growing design &amp; technology company specializing in the process and practice of envisioning, designing and building digital products. Our expertise rests on three key pillars: lean user experience design, agile product development, and open source software. Based in Toronto, our team of over 65 represents a full complement of designers, user researchers, developers, QA specialists, and business analysts.</p>
<p>Unlike digital agencies, we don&#39;t do campaigns; instead, we work on products and platforms that have a real impact on our clients’ users and business. Whether we’re building a marketplace for millions of small business customers, or an advanced data visualization tool for internal power users, we seek to create meaning in our work. </p>
<p>Technical expertise includes Drupal, front-end JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js and Angular.js, and the Symfony framework.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, our team has more than doubled each year since. </p>
