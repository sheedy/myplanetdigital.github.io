			<h3 id="location">Location</h3>
<p>Toronto, Vancouver, Ukraine</p>
<h3 id="about-the-position">About the position</h3>
<p>Work with renowned Drupal experts and a very talented extended team to build solutions for some of the world’s biggest Drupal sites.
You&#39;ll be tasked with building important systems for interesting clients, with plenty of technical challenges. You&#39;ll work in a Scrum team, primarily with Drupal/PHP to start and with plenty of opportunities to learn and branch out as you go.</p>
<h3 id="about-you">About you</h3>
<p>You live and breathe Drupal and your relationship with the water droplet keeps on keepin&#39; on. A background in computer/software engineering or computer science is strongly preferred, but we&#39;re open if you can demonstrate you know your stuff and have a nonconventional degree. We&#39;re looking for 1-2yrs experience (if you&#39;re fresh out of school get in touch anyway). Double points if you have startup experience.</p>
<p>We mostly work in PHP, but diverse language experience is a plus. It&#39;s more important that you&#39;re smart and driven than that you&#39;re a PHP expert. If you&#39;ve played around with node.js, iOS development, HTML5, Python, Ruby/Rails 3, Android dev, Facebook app dev, etc., those are all positives.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a few key attributes we’re looking for:</li>
<li><strong>You know Drupal inside and out.</strong>  But you keep pushing to learn more, know more, and do more. All of your skills will be put to the test working on projects that contribute back to the Drupal community.</li>
<li><strong>You’re agile.</strong>  Sort of like a Cheetah, but more so like a member of a self-organizing, well-oiled, cross-functional team. Terms like Drush, Distro and iteration make your pack stronger and hungrier. Did we mention we like cat metaphors?</li>
<li><strong>You’re a great communicator.</strong> We run on SCRUM, so almost all of our work is team-based. You need to collaborate effectively both in person and in writing. Bonus points if you’re a blogger. Multiplier points if you actively contribute back to the community.</li>
<li><strong>You’re #1 at something.</strong> Show us you know how to be great, whether it’s as a cyclist or professional hacky-sack enthusiast.</li>
<li><strong>You get stuff done.</strong> You would rather just build it than debate it. You let your code do the talking.</li>
<li><strong>You’re intense.</strong> You don’t stop until you get what you want. You have “the look”, described by some as “fire in the eyes” and by the less-informed as “bats#%t crazy”.</li>
<li><strong>You’re crazy (like a fox!).</strong> If we do the same things as everyone else, we’ll get mediocre results. This position requires you to question every idea, test every assumption, and refactor like a demon.</li>
<li><strong>You’re a prodigy.</strong> You’ve been building stuff since you were a wee lad/lass, and you can prove it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#39;re a startup guy/gal, you&#39;ll learn a lot just by being in our environment. You&#39;ll collide with amazingly smart developers, designers, analysts, and business folk - all of whom are constantly formulating new business models and thinking radical thoughts about the future. Bonus points if you like to endlessly philosophize.</p>
<h3 id="about-us">About us</h3>
<p>Myplanet is a rapidly growing design &amp; technology company specializing in the process and practice of envisioning, designing and building digital products. Our expertise rests on three key pillars: lean user experience design, agile product development, and open source software. Based in Toronto, our team of over 65 represents a full complement of designers, user researchers, developers, QA specialists, and business analysts.</p>
<p>Unlike digital agencies, we don&#39;t do campaigns; instead, we work on products and platforms that have a real impact on our clients’ users and business. Whether we’re building a marketplace for millions of small business customers, or an advanced data visualization tool for internal power users, we seek to create meaning in our work.</p>
<p>Technical expertise includes Drupal, front-end JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js and Angular.js, and the Symfony framework.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, our team has more than doubled each year since.</p>
