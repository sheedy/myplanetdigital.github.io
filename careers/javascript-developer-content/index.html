			<h3 id="location">Location</h3>
<p>Toronto</p>
<h3 id="about-the-position">About the position</h3>
<p>You&#39;ll be tasked with building digital products for high-profile Enterprise clients, with plenty of technical challenges and opportunities to learn as you go. You&#39;ll work as part of our newly formed Prototyping team, primarily with pure JavaScript and a couple of frameworks.</p>
<h3 id="about-you">About you</h3>
<p>A background in Computer/Software Engineering or Computer Science is strongly preferred, but we&#39;re open if you can demonstrate you know your stuff and have a non-conventional degree. Double points if you have Startup experience.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>2+ years experience working with pure JavaScript (not just libraries like jQuery)</li>
<li>Advanced understanding of modern web development fundamentals with HTML5 and CSS3</li>
<li>Strong understanding of the fundamentals of the language such as primitive and native data structures, async/event driven principles, understanding scope and the DOM</li>
<li>Object-oriented design principles as well as functional programming experience</li>
<li>Familiarity with CoffeScript, D3, and APIs such as Google Maps, Firebase, etc.</li>
<li>Node.js experience is a plus</li>
<li>Bonus if you have demonstratable experience writing test scripts for JavaScript applications</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few key attributes we’re looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You’re a great communicator.</strong> We run on Scrum, so almost all of our work is team-based. You need to be able to collaborate effectively both in person and in writing. Bonus points if you’re a blogger.</li>
<li><strong>You’re #1 at something.</strong> Show us you know how to be great, whether it’s as a cyclist or professional hacky-sack enthusiast.</li>
<li><strong>You get stuff done.</strong> You would rather just build it than debate it. You let your code do the talking.</li>
<li><strong>You’re intense.</strong> You don’t stop until you get what you want. You have “the look”, described by some as “fire in the eyes” and by the less-informed as “bats#%t crazy”.</li>
<li><strong>You’re crazy (like a fox!).</strong> If we do the same things as everyone else, we’ll get mediocre results. This position requires you to question every idea, test every assumption, and refactor like a demon.</li>
<li><strong>You’re a prodigy.</strong> You’ve been building stuff since you were a wee lad/lass, and you can prove it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#39;re a Startup guy/gal, you&#39;ll learn a lot just by being in our environment. You&#39;ll collide with amazingly smart developers, designers, analysts, and business folk - all of whom are constantly formulating new business models and thinking radical thoughts about the future. Bonus points if you like to endlessly philosophize.</p>
<h3 id="about-us">About us</h3>
<p>Myplanet is a rapidly growing design &amp; technology company specializing in the process and practice of envisioning, designing and building digital products. Our expertise rests on three key pillars: lean user experience design, agile product development, and open source software. Based in Toronto, our team of over 65 represents a full complement of designers, user researchers, developers, QA specialists, and business analysts.</p>
<p>Unlike digital agencies, we don&#39;t do campaigns; instead, we work on products and platforms that have a real impact on our clients’ users and business. Whether we’re building a marketplace for millions of small business customers, or an advanced data visualization tool for internal power users, we seek to create meaning in our work.</p>
<p>Technical expertise includes Drupal, front-end JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js and Angular.js, and the Symfony framework.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, our team has more than doubled each year since.</p>
