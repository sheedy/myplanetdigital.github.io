			<h3 id="location">Location</h3>
<p>Toronto, Vancouver</p>
<h3 id="about-the-position">About the position</h3>
<p>Work with a very talented extended team to evaluate and test enterprise-level solutions.  You&#39;ll be tasked with implementing automated frameworks, writing test plans, and enforcing best practices to build confidence in the accuracy of mission-critical business applications.  Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating and improving test strategies across several different Agile teams</li>
<li>Maintaining test plans, test scripts, and building test cases for both manual and automated testing procedure</li>
<li>Implementing Selenium or similar frameworks for front-end testing</li>
<li>Developing a robust reporting and tracking system for bugs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="about-you">About you</h3>
<p>You understand the importance of a robust testing process and get a kick out of breaking things (then fixing them).   A background in computer/software engineering or computer science is strongly preferred, but we&#39;re open if you can demonstrate you know your stuff and have a nonconventional degree.</p>
<p>We&#39;re looking for 1-2yrs experience (if you&#39;re fresh out of school get in touch anyway). Double points if you have startup experience.</p>
<p>We mostly work with web-based applications, but diverse testing experience is a plus. It&#39;s more important that you&#39;re smart and driven than that you&#39;re a web development expert. </p>
<p><strong>There are a few key attributes we’re looking for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You like to break things.</strong>  And you’re not satisfied until you find new ways to break them. All of your skills will be put to the test (pun intended) as you enhance the rigour of our process and quality of our solutions.</li>
<li><strong>You’re not scared of bugs.</strong>  You would rather go into dark corners and clean out the cobwebs proactively instead of reactively.</li>
<li><strong>You’re agile.</strong>  Sort of like a Cheetah, but more so like a member of a self-organizing, well-oiled, cross-functional team. You believe in quick iterations, and have the ability to pitch in wherever your help is needed.</li>
<li><strong>You’re a great communicator.</strong> We run on SCRUM, so almost all of our work is team-based. You need to collaborate effectively both in person and in writing. Bonus points if you’re a blogger.</li>
<li><strong>You’re #1 at something.</strong> Show us you know how to be great, whether it’s as a cyclist or professional hacky-sack enthusiast.</li>
<li><strong>You get stuff done.</strong> You would rather just do it than debate it. You let your work do the talking.</li>
<li><strong>You’re intense.</strong> You don’t stop until you get what you want. You have “the look”, described by some as “fire in the eyes” and by the less-informed as “bats#%t crazy”.</li>
<li><strong>You’re crazy (like a fox!).</strong> If we do the same things as everyone else, we’ll get mediocre results. This position requires you to question every idea, test every assumption, and refactor like a demon.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#39;re a startup guy/gal, you&#39;ll learn a lot just by being in our environment. You&#39;ll collide with amazingly smart developers, designers, analysts, and business folk - all of whom are constantly formulating new business models and thinking radical thoughts about the future.</p>
<h3 id="about-us">About us</h3>
<p>Myplanet is a rapidly growing design &amp; technology company specializing in the process and practice of envisioning, designing and building digital products. Our expertise rests on three key pillars: lean user experience design, agile product development, and open source software. Based in Toronto, our team of over 65 represents a full complement of designers, user researchers, developers, QA specialists, and business analysts.</p>
<p>Unlike digital agencies, we don&#39;t do campaigns; instead, we work on products and platforms that have a real impact on our clients’ users and business. Whether we’re building a marketplace for millions of small business customers, or an advanced data visualization tool for internal power users, we seek to create meaning in our work. </p>
<p>Technical expertise includes Drupal, front-end JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js and Angular.js, and the Symfony framework.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, our team has more than doubled each year since. </p>
