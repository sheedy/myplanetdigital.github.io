<h3 id="about-the-position">About the position</h3>
<p>As an Account Lead (AL), you will be responsible for working closely with our business development team to identify and respond to business opportunities. Presenting to potential clients, responding to RFPs and writing proposals will all be required.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll work with our clients to guide them through our project process, and alongside our internal teams to help generate scope, timeline and budget for each project. Your primary focus will be on ensuring client success throughout the lifecycle of project as well as looking for new opportunities within the account.</p>
<p>This role requires a balance of personal, technical and business skills in order to succeed. Focusing on a consultative sales process, the AL will foster long-term, positive relationships with his or her clients. With proven success in the role, there is an opportunity to move into a Strategic Account Manager role, focusing on Myplanet’s largest client accounts. </p>
<h3 id="about-you">About you</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>You have a degree in Business, Economics or Marketing.</strong> Or, you&#39;re an engineering or comp sci grad with strong communications skills.</li>
<li><strong>You&#39;re a people person.</strong> You&#39;re relationship-driven and are able to make connections easily. </li>
<li><strong>You know the interwebs.</strong> You have a strong understanding of and passion for web technologies.</li>
<li><strong>You can talk the talk.</strong> You have excellent verbal &amp; written communication skills.</li>
<li><strong>You’re #1 at something.</strong> Show us you know how to be great, whether it’s as a cyclist or professional hacky-sack enthusiast.</li>
<li><strong>You get stuff done.</strong> Cut through internal politics.You would rather just do it than debate it, then get feedback from end users to make it better.</li>
<li><strong>You’re intense.</strong> You don’t stop until you get what you want.You have “the look”, described by some as “fire in the eyes” and by the less-informed as “bats#%t crazy”.</li>
<li><strong>You’re crazy (like a fox!).</strong> If we do the same things as everyone else, we’ll get mediocre results. This position requires you to question every idea, test every assumption, and pivot as we see where the true opportunities lie.</li>
</ul>
