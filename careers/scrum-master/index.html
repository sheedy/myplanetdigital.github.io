<h3 id="about-the-position">About the position</h3>
<p>Your role is to facilitate the scrum process in our Agile teams by removing impediments, expanding the team’s capabilities, as well as maintaining an understanding of availability and progress. You will be working with a cross-functional team of developers, designers, and a Product Owner to deliver on-time and on-budget.</p>
<p>Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protects the team from outside distractions</li>
<li>Remove obstacles and blocks</li>
<li>Measure velocity and maintain project burndown chart</li>
<li>Helping the Product Owner with effective backlog management</li>
<li>Organizes scrum ceremonies, curate scrum artefacts</li>
<li>Help the team expand it’s capabilities through careful introspection</li>
<li>Mentoring, coaching and advisor for team members and team capabilities</li>
<li>Facilitate estimation and scheduling for future projects</li>
<li>Be a team member</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="about-you">About you</h3>
<p>You’ve mastered the art of helping a team conquer a challenge. Rather than lead the charge with a roaring voice, you’re the selfless leader who inspires people to their potential. We’re looking for individuals with at least one year of experience in a ScrumMaster role and a track record of facilitating successful agile teams.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You’re a natural facilitator.</strong> Your colleagues constantly tell you that you’ve got their backs. You understand that helping someone solve their own challenges is the best way to push them to the next level.</li>
<li><strong>You can listen.</strong> We run on SCRUM, so almost all of our work is team-based. We don’t believe in authoritarian rule, so you need to understand how to balance the interests of your team with the client’s needs.</li>
<li><strong>You’re agile.</strong>  Sort of like a Cheetah, but more so like being a member of a self-organizing, well-oiled, cross-functional team. You believe in quick iterations, and have the ability to pitch in wherever your help is needed.</li>
<li><strong>You get stuff done.</strong> Cut through internal politics. You would rather just do it than debate it, then get feedback from end users to make it better.</li>
<li><strong>You’re crazy (like a fox!).</strong> If we do the same things as everyone else, we’ll get mediocre results. This position requires you to question every idea, test every assumption, and pivot as we see where the true opportunities lie.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#39;re a startup guy/gal, you&#39;ll learn a lot just by being in our environment. You&#39;ll collide with amazingly smart developers, designers, analysts, and business folk - all of whom are constantly formulating new business models and thinking radical thoughts about the future.</p>
<h3 id="about-us">About us</h3>
<p>Myplanet is a rapidly growing design &amp; technology company specializing in the process and practice of envisioning, designing and building digital products. Our expertise rests on three key pillars: lean user experience design, agile product development, and open source software. Based in Toronto, our team of over 65 represents a full complement of designers, user researchers, developers, QA specialists, and business analysts.</p>
<p>Unlike digital agencies, we don&#39;t do campaigns; instead, we work on products and platforms that have a real impact on our clients’ users and business. Whether we’re building a marketplace for millions of small business customers, or an advanced data visualization tool for internal power users, we seek to create meaning in our work. </p>
<p>Technical expertise includes Drupal, front-end JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js and Angular.js, and the Symfony framework.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, our team has more than doubled each year since. </p>
