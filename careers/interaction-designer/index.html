<h3 id="about-us">About us</h3>
<p>Myplanet is a rapidly growing design &amp; technology company specializing in the process and practice of envisioning, designing and building digital products. Our expertise rests on three key pillars: lean user experience design, agile product development, and open source software. Based in Toronto, our team of over 65 represents a full complement of designers, user researchers, developers, QA specialists, and business analysts. </p>
<p>Unlike digital agencies, we don&#39;t do campaigns; instead, we work on products and platforms that have a real impact on our clients’ users and business. Whether we’re building a marketplace for millions of small business customers, or an advanced data visualization tool for internal power users, we seek to create meaning in our work. </p>
<p>Technical expertise includes Drupal, front-end JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js and Angular.js, and the Symfony framework.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, our team has more than doubled each year since. </p>
