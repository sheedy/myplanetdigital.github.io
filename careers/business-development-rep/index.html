<h3 id="about-the-position">About the position</h3>
<p>As a Business Development Representative (BDR), you will be responsible for generating opportunities with large companies for our Account Lead team. Working closely with the Director of Business Development, you will identify and research prospective clients, generate lists of decision-makers, and reach out via email and by phone.</p>
<p>BDR is a new and exciting role at Myplanet, giving you the opportunity to rapidly learn about the business and cultivate invaluable consultative sales skills while testing your communications skills to their limits. It will require hard work, potentially long hours, and a lot of hustle, but with support from your team it will quickly pay off. Success as a BDR will lead to opportunities to take and grow specific client accounts as an Account Lead or, eventually, a Strategic Account Manager. </p>
<h3 id="about-you">About you</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>You have a degree in Business, Economics or Marketing.</strong> Or, you&#39;re an engineering or comp sci grad with strong communications skills.</li>
<li><strong>You&#39;re a hustler.</strong> &#39;Nuff said </li>
<li><strong>You can talk the talk.</strong> You have excellent verbal &amp; written communication skills.</li>
<li><strong>You’re #1 at something.</strong> Show us you know how to be great, whether it’s as a cyclist or professional hacky-sack enthusiast.</li>
<li><strong>You get stuff done.</strong> Cut through internal politics.You would rather just do it than debate it, then get feedback from end users to make it better.</li>
<li><strong>You’re intense.</strong> You don’t stop until you get what you want.You have “the look”, described by some as “fire in the eyes” and by the less-informed as “bats#%t crazy”.</li>
<li><strong>You’re crazy (like a fox!).</strong> If we do the same things as everyone else, we’ll get mediocre results. This position requires you to question every idea, test every assumption, and pivot as we see where the true opportunities lie.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="about-us">About us</h3>

Based in Toronto, our team of over 65 represents a full complement of designers, user researchers, developers, QA specialists, and business analysts.</p>

Whether we’re building a marketplace for millions of small business customers, or an advanced data visualization tool for internal power users, we seek to create meaning in our work. </p>
<p>Technical expertise includes Drupal, front-end JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js and Angular.js, and the Symfony framework.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, our team has more than doubled each year since. </p>
