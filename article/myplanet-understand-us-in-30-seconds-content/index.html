<p>Building great digital products isn&#39;t easy. That&#39;s where we come in: we help organizations rapidly build user-focused web and mobile products. We combine the best aspects of Lean, Agile, and UX design methodologies.</p>
<p>But we don&#39;t just build things. We empower organizations to become lean, mean product development machines.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-do-well">What we do well</h3>
<p>There are four things that we do well:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>We help you figure out what to build, why, and for whom.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We turn that insight into beautiful web-based and mobile products.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We support your products and help you scale &amp; improve them.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We train and coach your organization to do what we do.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We build <em>high-performance, agile teams</em> that stick together from project to project. On average, we&#39;re 2-3x faster than inexperienced product teams. Each team has the skills makeup of a talented product startup, with the added benefit that they&#39;ve been through it before together. </p>
<h3 id="who-we-work-with">Who we work with</h3>
<p>We tend to work on products that emphasize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reach - The problem you&#39;re solving can potentially impact large numbers of people directly or indirectly.</li>
<li>Impact - People care about the problem, and it has a significant impact on their lives.</li>
<li>Innovation - There is something new and novel in the approach being taken.</li>
<li>Agility - There an emphasis on speed, relentless iteration and absolute focus on users.</li>
<li>Experience - Users are given an unforgettable experience when interacting with the product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes we make trade-offs - we&#39;re okay with products that deeply impact a small number of people. But these criteria guide our client selection and help us stay focused as a company.</p>
