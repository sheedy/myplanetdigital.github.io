<p>The <a href="http://www.yorktech.ca/">York Technology Alliance</a> is a network of more than 200 tech organizations that provides support, resources &amp; collaborative opportunities for its members. Each year the YTA hosts the Technology Leadership Awards to recognize outstanding achievement in the GTA&#39;s tech landscape.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased to announce the winners of the 2013 YTA Technology Leadership Awards&quot; said Patrick Shaw, YTA Executive Director. &quot;These are exciting, innovative companies that are creating outstanding successes in one of the most enterprising technology regions of the world&quot;.</p>
<p>Myplanet was honoured to win Momentum Company of the Year at last week&#39;s gala. This award recognizes an organization that has demonstrated excellence in innovation and a commitment to the knowledge-based sector in the Greater Toronto Region while consistently reaching new customers or delivering new services within an existing customer, increasing revenues, adding employees, encouraging community involvement and embracing sound business fundamentals.</p>
