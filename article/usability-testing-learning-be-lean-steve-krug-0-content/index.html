<p>While lean usability testing may be the latest craze, usability pioneer Steve Krug has been working with this approach from almost 12 years, as I learned this past Wednesday during his presentation at the University of Toronto&#39;s iSchool. Author of the seminal book Don&#39;t Make Me Think from 2000, Steve Krug has done more than his fair share to promote the benefits of usability and led the charge in developing simple and quick usability testing processes. Listening to Steve talk was both reassuring and inspiring, reassuring because Myplanet has already implemented many of the ideas he discussed and inspiring because many his points suggested way to combat issues we have experienced.</p>
<p>Unlike some usability gurus, Steve takes a very frank and honest approach to usability testing, stating up front that there is no magic recipe, and there are no hard and fast rules. He simply defines usability testing as, &quot;watching people use a product, as they externalize their thoughts&quot;. Bringing it back to this fundamental level allows us to really focus on what is important about usability testing and why we do it in the first place. This basic description differs greatly from what many may think of when they hear usability testing: an expensive procedure conducted inside a lab with high tech video equipment and two-way mirrors observing at least 8 participants a day and resulting in a large report that collates all the data. While this may have been the state of usability testing a decade ago, Steve is quick to point out that most of the tools necessary to run a full-scale test yourself are readily available and relatively cheap. As Steve put it, &quot;You&#39;re not doing usability testing? Are youâ€¦nuts?&quot;</p>
<p>Because of the ease of access, the process of conducting usability testing becomes a key focus. Steve uses a series of maxims, (see no rules!) to summarize his approach to lean do-it-yourself testing. The first is to focus on only testing with 3 users. While the number of test participants is a hotly contested issue in the world of usability, Steve rightly points out that this number of users will not identify all the issues, not even coming close to identifying the majority of the issues, but the beauty of this number is that it will still identify more issues than a team could feasible tackle prior to the next test session. Yes, participant 8 may bring a crucial issue to the table, but most likely the first 3 users will identify a laundry list of problem areas. </p>
<p>If you&#39;re thinking 3 users is rather low to test your soon-to-launch project, that&#39;s because you are waiting too long to test. Steve cautions to start testing earlier than you think, something we take very seriously at Myplanet. Rather than waiting until development begins, we test our sketches, wireframes, comps and even prototypes to insure that issues are caught early. Performing quick tests of this kind is easy to do and ends up saving way more time then they take. Steve takes it to the next level by suggesting that you can even do usability tests using competitor products that aim to achieve the same goal, even before you have begun a project.</p>
<p>Steve takes an interesting approach to recruiting users for usability testing too, &quot;loose recruiting, grade on a curve&quot;. By this he means that you shouldn&#39;t be waiting until you have your target demographic perfectly lined up for testing; instead start with readily available people and get more focused as you go. Waiting for these finely targeted users is one of the key reasons why people end up not even getting to testing, according to Steve. Early testing with any subject will identify core usability issues, but it is key to take the time to evaluate if any problems encountered during these loose test are real issues or the result of a lack of expertise or context. 
Once you have your subjects, actually conducting the usability test is the nest step. While some professionals may opt to use a loose guide over a script, Steve explains that even the best testers can&#39;t resist obvious faux-pas when they go off-book, using the words &quot;feedback&quot; or &quot;opinions&quot; that may influence the user&#39;s natural responses. Sticking to the script is key, as Steve proved during a live usability test he conducted with a member of the audience. This got the audience involved and proved that even testing a highly revered mobile application with a PhD candidate as your test subject can highlight key usability flaws.</p>
<p>Next on Steve&#39;s list of maxims is skipping the lengthy report, that probably won&#39;t get read by the very people that should read it. Instead, get stakeholders to witness the test firsthand, whether it&#39;s through a live screen cast from the test location to the boardroom or a video of the user played back at a later time. Seeing a real user struggling with an interface or troubled by a menu&#39;s organization will trump a report any day.  Whether it&#39;s the developers who will be transforming the test findings into improvements or the business stakeholders who need to approve those fixes, seeing is believing in the case of usability testing. At Myplanet we wholeheartedly agree with skipping unessisary documentation and Steve had a simple technique for capturing the findings from sessions that enables all participants to get what they need with as little waste as possible (very lean!). As individuals watch the user tests, they should record a maximum of 3 key issues per user. After testing is complete, all the observers should debrief together using their list of 3 points per user as the input for discussion. From this discussion, the team involved will build consensus on what issues need the most attention and even how they could be solved. This plan of action can simply be typed up in point form and emailed to everyone for reference. Goodbye report and hello efficient lean documentation.
Continuing the lean approach, Steve&#39;s next maxim was, &quot;when fixing problems, do the least you can do&quot;. Instead of redesigning things to try and solve every problem, simply tweak what is needed and retest. As Steve pointed out, redesigning may solve your problem but in the process you may also be getting rid of things that worked fine in the first place. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most crucial maxim for usability professionals is avoiding statistics and building up faux validity. Often clients won&#39;t be convinced of a decision until they have hard numbers to support it. While usability testing can expose issues and suggest improvements, test sessions aren&#39;t a substitute for quantitative data. By its very nature, a test conducted on 3 users is far from conclusive. Thus resisting the temptation to turn qualitative findings into quantitative data is a key maxim to keep in mind when presenting findings to internal or client stakeholders.</p>
<p>Steve obviously has a ton of experience in the world of usability, but his down to earth approach is a refreshing take that we can definitely get behind. Usability testing isn&#39;t something that should be locked up in the ivory tower, anyone creating ideas or developing products can take advantage of the benefits of usability testing, and SHOULD. Myplanet is constantly optimizing our own testing procedures and we will definitely be referencing some of Steve&#39;s helpful maxims.</p>
