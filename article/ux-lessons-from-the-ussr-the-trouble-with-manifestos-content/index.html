<p>Erik has spent some time writing about the Myplanet process in our &quot;<a href="http://www.youredm.com/2013/05/13/daft-punks-random-access-memories-leaked/">How We Work</a>&quot; series, examining the ways in which our process has evolved to support clients, staff and quality of work. He believes that collectively, a process &#39;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricolage">bricolage</a>&#39; is critical to creating amazing digital products. </p>
<p>As a speaker at <a href="http://fitc.ca/event/to13/">FITC Toronto</a> this year, Erik elevated this discussion with a talk titled, &quot;UX Lessons From The USSR: The Trouble With Manifestos&quot;. Throughout his presentation, Erik argued that creating digital products is an interdisciplinary undertaking, and that the process we use should also embrace diverse methods where they make sense.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s an overview of Erik&#39;s presentation:</strong></p>
<p>Agile purists, human-centered advocates, lean UX. Manifestos, credos, value-laden proclamations. The intersection of user experience and process is the site of intense debate and scrutiny as various schools of thought enter and transform UX discourse. Relativist arguments and trump cards abound (“if you had to modify the method, you weren’t doing it right;“ “the rules require that you abandon all rules”; “it’s not true x or y”). But is a dogmatic approach truly effective for building user experiences in a professional services context? What does Agile look like outside of software product development and where do the rules need to bend to serve clients effectively? In an attempt to share findings, lessons, and insight with other young user experience companies, this talk explores some of the trials, tribulations, steps and missteps we’ve experienced over the past year while evolving into an Agile UX professional services company.</p>
<p>Erik&#39;s talk was well received  &amp; sparked some interesting debate surrounding the idea of process bricolage. <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MyplanetDigital/ux-lessons-from-the-ussr-the-trouble-with-manifestos">Slides from his presentation are available here.</a> </strong>Stay tuned for the video!</p>
