Why do some succeed while others flounder? Our new Product Innovators series aims to uncover the secrets behind effective product development.</h2>
<p>Our first Product Innovator is Craig Follett, co-founder of Uniiverse. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.uniiverse.com/">Uniiverse</a> is an online community marketplace for people to create and discover services and activities near them. Users can share their interests, resources, time, space, skills, and knowledge in real life - for free, or to make a little bit of money. </p>
<p>We asked Craig a few questions to understand why &amp; how Uniiverse has grown from zero to 50,000 users in its first year.</p>
<h4 id="what-drove-the-idea-for-uniiverse-how-did-it-come-to-fruition-">What drove the idea for Uniiverse? How did it come to fruition?</h4>
<p>Uniiverse came from the inspiration that we felt something was broken in the world. People’s relationships are becoming more and more virtual. We use Twitter, Facebook and all of these social networks, but it seems sort of disconnected. You may have 500 friends on Facebook, but what does that really mean and are you really connecting with them in real life? We wanted to create something that’s going to have an impact and that’s going to improve people’s lives by getting people to connect and actually do things together.</p>
<p>The past decades have been about hyper-consumption and singular ownership, and somewhat materialistic. Looking forward to next couple of decades, it is going to be more about joint ownership -- access rather than ownership and about experiences rather than things. I think there’s a trend where new generations are just generally predisposed to collaborative consumption and to the sharing economy – it’s deep rooted in them. Everyone deep down has a passion and an interest in sharing and in meeting new people.</p>
<h4 id="describe-the-process-you-employed-for-actually-designing-building-the-site-">Describe the process you employed for actually designing &amp; building the site.</h4>
<p>We looked to traditional real life marketplaces that have been around for centuries, and thrived before the industrial revolution: street markets, bazaars and farmers markets. Not only do farmers markets literally have both chickens and eggs, but markets like these give clues into buyer and seller behaviors, and are a great analogy for building an awesome new local marketplace – like Uniiverse. </p>
<h4 id="how-is-your-team-structured-">How is your team structured?</h4>
<p>The Uniiverse team consists of 9 employees. The three co-founders: Ben Raffi, myself, and Adam Meghji lead a team of developers and marketers. </p>
<h4 id="what-was-your-initial-approach-for-driving-traffic-to-the-site-how-did-you-spread-the-word-">What was your initial approach for driving traffic to the site? How did you spread the word?</h4>
<p>When Uniiverse launched, there was a media relations strategy in place which resulted in a good amount of press right off the bat. After that, we focused on many streams of marketing including social media, street marketing, events, word-of-mouth, and community outreach.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-the-business-goals-for-uniiverse-what-are-your-hopes-for-the-future-">What are the business goals for Uniiverse? What are your hopes for the future?</h4>
<p>Uniiverse hopes to be for the sharing economy what eBay is to peer-to-peer product marketplaces. We have seen the site grow from zero to 50,000 users in the first year, and look forward to seeing it accelerate further. </p>
<p>Thanks to Craig &amp; the team at Uniiverse for launching the Product Innovators series with us. Stay tuned for further interviews!</p>
