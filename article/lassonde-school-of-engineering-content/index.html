<h3 id="developing-the-intricate-link-between-creativity-and-engineering-">Developing the intricate link between creativity and engineering.</h3>
<p>With the growth of the Lassonce School of Engineering within the York University Community, Myplanet was excited about the oppourtunity to play a key role in not only designing the web presence, but also in building the brand that will represent the school for years to come.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The site needed to be flexible enough to fully represent each department within the Lassonde School of Engineering, while maintaining the main brand of the school. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beginning with in-depth user and stakeholder research, the Myplanet team was tasked to understand the key needs of the primary users of the site. Building personas for prospective students, current students, outside community members and staff/faculty, the user research team was able to develop a thorough understanding of the site’s key users. </p>

<h3 id="telling-the-lassonde-story-">Telling the Lassonde story.</h3>
<p>The main goal of the new Lassonde website was to tell a <strong>story</strong>; to challenge the perception of engineering and education by focusing on creative thinking. Every student is a citizen of the Renassance Engineers™ movement. Creating a sense of community for students to connect, learn and engage across multiple disciplines and perspectives was important for demonstrating why Lassonde is so unique. </p>

<p>Lassonde provides visitors with an immersive experience for first time visitors, prospective students, faculty/staff and outside community members. Myplanet cultivated the narrative of Renaissance Engineering through a continuum that shed an  inspirational light into the power of embracing creative thinking in a more traditional field. With this story, we have the power to influence a generation of go-getters that help shape our future.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-holistic-experience-through-compelling-content-">Creating a holistic experience through compelling content.</h3>
<p>Unifying content across multiple mediums proved difficult. Using user-centered content creation and curation, the Lassonde website is an encompassing experience with rich content and interactivity that promotes enagement and exploration. By focusing on real user goals, Myplanet was able to build a frictionless &quot;navigation-as-needed&quot; approach that guided users to appropriate content, without overwheleming them with options.</p>
