<h3 id="developing-the-intricate-link-between-creativity-and-engineering-">Developing the intricate link between creativity and engineering.</h3>
<p>With the growth of the Lassonce School of Engineering within the York University Community, Myplanet was excited about the oppourtunity to play a key role in not only designing the web presence, but also in building the brand that will represent the school for years to come.</p>
<p>Beginning with in-depth user and stakeholder research, the Myplanet team was tasked to understand the key needs of the primary users of the site. Building personas for prospective students, current students, outside community members and staff/faculty, the user research team was able to develop a thorough understanding of the site’s key users. </p>
<p>The site needed to be flexible enough to fully represent each department within the Lassonde School of Engineering while maintaining the main brand of the school. Each department and faculty self manages their content through the Drupal CMS.</p>
