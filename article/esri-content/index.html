<p>After extensive user research and 
design consultation, Myplanet delivered a 
responsive design with intuitive content 
strategy and enhanced functionality</p>
<p>The task was to examine Esri Canada’s information architecture, interaction patterns and overall content strategy to design and build a unified digital experience for their users. But how could a single website balance the needs of various users from different industries and on different devices, while supporting a deep, multi-layered navigation structure? We readily donned our spacesuits and accepted the challenge. </p>
<p>The task was to examine Esri Canada’s information architecture, interaction patterns and overall content strategy to design and build a unified digital experience for their users. But how could a single website balance the needs of various users from different industries and on different devices, while supporting a deep, multi-layered navigation structure? We readily donned our spacesuits and accepted the challenge. </p>
<p>In addition, our user research quickly revealed a need to provide focused content to users who belong to different industries and use Esri Canada products in a variety of ways. </p>
<p>To satisfy this need, we implemented a “Catered 
Content Delivery” strategy across the site with 
emphasis on heavier traffic areas and sections where information would be shared across multiple user types. Now, the website’s filterable lists, taxonomy relationships to aggregate information, iconography and colour help orient the different user groups and provide them with the necessary tools to efficiently retrieve information. </p>
<p>At the same time, our content strategy maximizes 
the value of contextual content encounters. For 
example, healthcare professionals visiting Esri 
Canada’s website may access the healthcare industry hub page and explore the case studies they were looking for, as well as other resources aggregated and tagged with “healthcare.” Or, while reading through relevant GIS applications and learning how Esri solutions could benefit their industry, they could also take note of industry-specific testimonials and view upcoming training and events related to the solutions used in their industry. </p>
<p>Our phased Agile UX process, research, and 
defining system needs in terms of user goals 
unveiled many complexities and challenges, which 
we solved through prototyping and testing. The
challenges we faced led us to think about the system holistically and in the end, Myplanet and Esri Canada launched a successful website. The new website has been well-received and is helping the company provide a better customer experience. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Myplanet took the time to learn our business and created an exceptionally well-thought-out website design. As a result, our new website provides users more options to find the information they’re looking for quickly and 
efficiently.” </p>
