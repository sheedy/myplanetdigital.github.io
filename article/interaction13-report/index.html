			<h2 id="last-week-s-interaction13-conference-hosted-right-here-in-toronto-drew-in-800-attendees-over-5-days-and-included-more-than-70-workshops-and-talks-">Last week’s Interaction13 conference, hosted right here in Toronto, drew in 800 attendees over 5 days and included more than 70 workshops and talks.</h2>
<p><strong>We bring you our personal highlights, reflections and running themes from this world-class design event.</strong></p>
<p>As you may have noticed from our preview post for the conference, choosing sessions in this jam-packed schedule was rather difficult, but we managed to see a lot and learn even more.</p>
<p>I kicked off my conference experience by attending a full-day workshop at OCAD university, hosted by <a href="http://normative.com/">Normative’s Matthew Milan and Robyn Polan</a>. The workshop focused on &quot;Intent Planning&quot;, a tool developed by their studio to help structure the creation of design strategy. The full-day format gave attendees the chance to really dig into the material and try it out in a few case studies. Talking with other conference-goers, the workshop format was a big success and something many want to see more of for next year’s event.</p>
<p>Monday saw <a href="http://www.odannyboy.com/">Dan Saffer&#39;s</a> Microinteractions talk, where he pointed out that the details can either make a product or become “a pebble in your shoe”. The tangible, focus-on-the-details approach was a common thread of the conference, running between many talks including <a href="http://blog.derekvaz.com/">Derek Vaz’s</a> on Interaction Prototyping and <a href="https://twitter.com/ixbuzz">Behzad Aghaei’s</a> on buttonless interactions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The difference between a product you love and one you tolerate are the microinteractions you have with it.”</p>
<div class="source"><span>Dan Saffer</span></div>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://about.me/johannakoll">Johanna Kolmann</a> &amp; <a href="http://martinaschell.com/">Martina Schell</a> were the first to speak on applying theoretical and practical learnings from the Lean Startup methodology to design. Their talk provided a first hand look at how they have integrated these ideas into their own practises and the challenges associated with this approach. Other talks exploring this same idea included, <a href="http://joshuaseiden.com/">Josh Seiden’s</a> “A Designer&#39;s Introduction to Lean Startup”, the co-author of the upcoming book “Lean UX”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re selling a team and a process, not an outcome: because you can&#39;t predict that&quot;</p>
<div class="source"><span>Johanna Kolmann &amp; Martina Schell</span></div>

</blockquote>
<p>In this same vein, another key theme that took shape during the conference was the evolving role of UX designers. <a href="https://twitter.com/cchastain">Cindy Chastain’s</a> nailed it when she presented “New Frontiers: the UX professional as business consultant”, exploring how designers can provide value closer to the strategy table and the c-suite. This topic quickly became the talk of the conference, getting mentions in other talks and panels and stirring some heated debate in the redux discussions on Thursday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A lot of business problems that fail in analytic approaches are much better served with a design approach.</p>
<div class="source"><span>Steve Baty via Cindy Chastain’s presentation</span></div>

</blockquote>
<p>While &quot;designers at the strategy table&quot; was perhaps the most debated issue, designing for social experiences and big data took precedence as the biggest running themes, each anchored by powerful keynotes.</p>
<p>In the realm of social, Facebook’s <a href="http://www.thinkoutsidein.com/">Paul Adams</a>, tackled the theme at a high level with his Wednesday morning keynote “How to design social experiences”, while <a href="http://intenseminimalism.com/">Davide Casali’s</a> presentation &quot;Social Experience Design: Shifting The Focus Where Really Matters” took a more practical approach. Beyond these talks, many others were talking about making social a bigger consideration in design decision making.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As the web becomes more social, there will be less human computer interactions and more human to human interactions”</p>
<div class="source"><span>Paul Adams</span></div>

</blockquote>
<p>As the output of many social interactions, big data was the other big topic (pun intended! - <em><em>Editor&#39;s note: Nate is a master of terrible puns</em></em>). <a href="http://blprnt.com/">Jer Thorpe</a> led this discussion, starting with his Tuesday keynote and panel session later that day. Big Data was definitely the topic du jour, finding its way into many presentations and hallway discussions, clearly a subject in the front of many designer’s minds, prompting more questions than answers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Data tells a story about our lives”</p>
<div class="source"><span>Jer Thorpe</span></div>

</blockquote>
<p>To wrap up the conference, Thursday featured redux presentations to give everyone a chance to mull over the events of the previous days. Of the three, <a href="http://www.jeroenvangeel.com/">Jeroen Van Geel’s</a> presentation seemed to resonate most deeply with the audience and is a good companion piece to this post, pulling together the big themes (view his post <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jeroenvangeel/ixd13-redux2013">here</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think we will change the world. We will add something to the conversation and change the world a little bit&quot;</p>
<div class="source"><span>Jeroen Van Geel</span></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Overall, the conference was a tremendous experience that was insightful and inspiring. My biggest take-away came after talking with designers and non-designers from Canada, the US and across the world, who all had a sense that the discipline of interaction design is at a pivotal point. A lot has changed since the founding of the IXDA ten years ago and we need to begin to think about where we are going to be ten years from now. While this uncertainty may worry some, I trust in the knowledge, talent, values and motivations of everyone in attendance to use this opportunity wisely.</p>
<p>See you for <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/">Interaction14</a> in Amsterdam!</p>
