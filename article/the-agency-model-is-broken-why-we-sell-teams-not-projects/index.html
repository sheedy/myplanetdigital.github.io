			<h2 id="the-agency-model-is-broken-here-s-how-we-re-trying-to-fix-it-">The agency model is broken. Here&#39;s how we&#39;re trying to fix it.</h2>
<p>In the typical model for project work at a digital agency, a contract would lay out the scope of work (often in considerable depth), the cost per deliverable, and the expected delivery date.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not difficult to see where this model is fundamentally broken. Disputes bubble up over what&#39;s in scope (&quot;You told us we were getting iconography!&quot; &quot;Yes, but not an infinite amount&quot;), when it&#39;s supposed to be done (&quot;You said you&#39;d deliver this list of 50 things by March 5th!&quot; &quot;Yes, but you added ten NEW things.&quot;), and how closely the scope is actually followed (&quot;You wrote here that we would be getting an intro page with a sexy animation&quot; &quot;Yes, but it had a 98% bounce rate&quot;)</p>
<p>The typical solution to such problems is to implement agile: Focus on user goals by maintaining a backlog of &quot;user stories&quot;; commit to delivering small, defined chunks of potentially shippable work; and prioritize on a frequent basis by moving items up and down the backlog or by swapping them in or out.</p>
<p>But rolling out agile (REAL agile, not half-assed agile) is still only a half-solution, no matter how perfectly executed. Sure, it&#39;s now much easier to adapt to changing requirements and effectively prioritize work, but if you&#39;re working to a fixed-scope, fixed-budget, fixed-time contract, you&#39;re not practicing agile. You&#39;re practicing mini-waterfall.</p>
<p>We made the classic mistakes. After over a year of improving our practice of agile to the point where we were seeing real results (Scrum, in particular), we were still signing fixed-price, fixed-scope contracts. It was a monumental culture clash that was bad for us and bad for our clients.</p>
<p>When we finally decided to reflect our practice in our contracts in spite of our reservations, things went better than expected. Clients got the certainty of working with a team whose members had found a groove, had worked on a similar project before, and had gotten pretty good at estimating their actual work output. We didn&#39;t promise that we&#39;d deliver on a fixed set of requirements, but it didn&#39;t matter - clients thought of us as an extension of their internal teams with a level of expertise it takes a long time to perfect.</p>
<p>We now introduce prospective clients to the team they&#39;ll likely be working with from day one. This team has the skills we believe necessary to meet the clients&#39; needs in their entirety, from design through QA (excluding a few specialists who tend to work across teams). And in the parlance of high-performance teams, they have already progressed through the necessary but messy process of team forming and storming. In arriving at &quot;norming&quot;, they understand each member&#39;s work style and how to accommodate it. Non-productive team members or mis-hires are identified and either moved to another team or let go.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s all great, but a waterfall project could give you a dedicated team too. What&#39;s really different? 
Rather than delivering the same old trusty project estimate, we offer a rather unusual promise: As a client, you will receive the undivided output of one or more appropriately skilled teams for a period of X weeks. During that time, the team will produce work that satisfies an agreed-upon set of user goals and business needs. While we cannot guarantee that we will satisfy each goal to a rigid set of requirements (for example, an interactive server configurator might be implemented as a simple drop-down list as time and priority dictates), we guarantee that we will satisfy each of these goals a high-quality way. Furthermore, we remain flexible enough to allow new information (from stakeholders, users, or some other source) to alter the direction we take as the project progresses. </p>
<p>In a fixed amount of time and for a fixed amount of budget, clients receive a product that satisfies both user needs and business goals. We call it the &quot;Minimum Desirable Product&quot;, and what we deliver can serve as a baseline for many more iterations throughout the product or platform&#39;s life cycle.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it can be a hard sell. There is a lack of context and experience when it comes to working within such a model, and sometimes it can make executives a little nervous (they&#39;ve all been badly burned at some point or another). But regardless of where they begin, clients inevitably come to view it as a refreshingly honest and straightforward method of building a really great user experience and, subsequently, a valuable and usable product.</p>
<p>In the end, we just want to build great products. Selling teams might not be the only way, but it&#39;s the best way we&#39;ve found.</p>
