Outside-in, over and over again, as efficiently as possible.</h2>
<p>Of course, the challenge lies in the details. While the Myplanet Way is based loosely on Lean UX (link out?), the choice of specific practices, techniques, and exact process vary by offering and customer need. While we firmly believe in the principles that underpin Lean, Agile, and User-Centered Design, our approach is based in a willingness to mix, match, and integrate various practices where applicable. We use what works. </p>
<p>Broadly, here is how our approach typically maps to a project across our offerings.</p>
<h2 id="1-build-a-great-team-with-multidisciplinary-skills-add-two-cups-of-coffee-and-stir-thoroughly-">1. Build a great team with multidisciplinary skills. Add two cups of coffee and stir thoroughly.</h2>
<p>We believe that building great web products is an intensely multidisciplinary undertaking. Our team structures balance the need for top-notch specialist expertise with generalist flexibility. We look for designers, developers, and business thinkers who obsess over products and eagerly engage with other disciplines, but always through the lens of their core competency. This &quot;T-shapedness&quot; means more minds solving more problems, collaboratively. The result? A measurably better product.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="2-start-with-a-hypothesis-about-the-opportunity-need-problem-or-idea-be-prepared-to-ask-why-like-an-eight-year-old-in-science-class-">2. Start with a hypothesis about the opportunity, need, problem, or idea. Be prepared to ask &quot;Why?&quot; like an eight-year-old in science class.</h2>
<p>We all want to create products that people actually want to use. To achieve this, we need to validate our big ideas before we get into the details. In some instances, we begin with focused research and synthesis to narrow the range of options before we start to build. In others, we begin with a minimum viable product and test the value of the product idea against users. In either case, we rapidly validate (or invalidate) true demand for a product idea with users and stakeholders. Rather than speculate on features, we actively define our potential product in terms of user goals to keep the doors open for potential solutions.</p>
<p>Example opportunity hypothesis: Network administrators need a better way to manage the connections between virtual networks.
Validation: In reality, network administrators need a better way to communicate the nature of changes to these connections to their staff.</p>
<p>Techniques &amp; practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stakeholder interviews</li>
<li>User interviews &amp; contextual inquiry</li>
<li>User observation</li>
<li>Comparative analysis</li>
<li>Story mapping <hr>


</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-go-deeper-model-and-test-potential-executions-to-solve-for-the-opportunity-or-problem-narrow-the-range-of-options-be-ok-with-broad-brush-strokes-">3. Go deeper: Model and test potential executions to solve for the opportunity or problem. Narrow the range of options. Be ok with broad brush strokes.</h2>
<p>Given a validated need, we can confidently iterate our product from intangible goals to tangible solution, always with a Lean mindset. But rather than jump immediately into the details, we design and build at the level of fidelity necessary to validate or invalidate our next set of hypotheses. We model potential solutions, measure their appropriateness according to utility, usability, and feasibility, and iterate on the product with the strongest option.</p>
<p>Example hypothesis: A communications product that provides latent notifications by email to staff when networks are updated will be desirable, feasible, and usable.
Validation: While our approach is desirable and usable, the proposed technical architecture will not support this approach. Time to iterate on another architecture.</p>
<p>Techniques &amp; practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design studios/workshops</li>
<li>Interaction modelling</li>
<li>Archetype mapping &amp; content planning</li>
<li>Art boarding/UI component design</li>
<li>Prototyping</li>
<li>User testing</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2 id="4-develop-rapidly-towards-a-full-solution-build-only-what-s-needed-for-validation-at-ever-increasing-levels-of-fidelity-minimize-waste-get-your-dev-on-">4. Develop rapidly towards a full solution: Build only what&#39;s needed for validation at ever-increasing levels of fidelity. Minimize waste. Get your dev on.</h2>
<p>To support ongoing validation and iteration, we employ Agile development methodologies. Where traditional design and development practices invest substantial effort in upfront specification, Agile encourages us to design and build in small, incremental units as more and more details about the product opportunity reveal themselves. Grouped into sprints, these production iterations and the features they include represent yet another set of hypotheses: we assume the features are desired, usable, technically viable, and generate ROI. After each sprint, Agile provides defined opportunities to pivot if ideas are invalidated—with users, stakeholders, or the team itself—without fear of wasting an enormous amount of spent budget or time.</p>
<p>Example hypothesis for a specific feature: Our communications product should have a lazy registration system so that network administrators will not need to sign up before they start using it.
Validation: The lazy registration form is very usable, and technically viable—but it seems to have little impact on user registrations. It improves the UX, but does not increase subscriptions.</p>
<p>Techniques &amp; practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backlog grooming</li>
<li>Design studios/workshops</li>
<li>Synchronous design &amp; development</li>
<li>Prototyping</li>
<li>User testing</li>
<li>Continuous delivery</li>
</ul>
<hr>


<h2 id="5-extend-the-solution-explore-new-opportunities-and-enhance-the-product-level-up-">5. Extend the solution: Explore new opportunities and enhance the product. Level up.</h2>
<p>Every new feature is a chance to further validate the value of a product, refine the experience, and optimize performance. A successful product release is not the end of our product process, but the beginning of an entirely new set of experiments designed to drive growth for and support the product.</p>
<p>Example hypothesis: Our communications product has been very successful for network administrators. We believe new features on the front-end will also satisfy pain points for their staff.
Validation: Return to step 2.</p>
<p>Techniques &amp; practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>UX audit</li>
<li>Cohort analysis</li>
<li>Performance audit</li>
</ul>
