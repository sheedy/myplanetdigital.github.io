Examples are all around us; objects that act as a bridge between two different groups, building mutual understanding.</h2>
<p>They help us bridge the gap between designers and developers (photoshop compositions), and developers and business people (user stories).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Boundary objects are objects which are both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and constraints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Design research is one area with huge opportunity to experiment with the creation of new boundary objects, helping improve understanding of the field and positively impact its influence. <a href="http://vimeo.com/33620080#">Todd Cherkasky’s excellent presentation</a> from the 2011 Design Research Conference captures many great thoughts on this that I will delve into.</p>
<p>His most salient point was the idea of creating a “plate” for collaboration between disciplines. In other words not just a boundary object, but boundary frameworks that could elicit deeper collaboration between groups.
This has deep implications on design research, helping facilitate an understanding of research that extends beyond documentation and deliverables, and moves into collaborative processes. While boundary objects are key to this approach, they can be thought of as the output of frameworks, gaining more traction thanks to the added context of collaboration.</p>
<h3 id="engaging-with-research">Engaging with Research</h3>
<p>Cherkasky gives the example of a consumer ecosystem map that frames experience from a user perspective, while overlaying and connecting it to the organization and key business metrics to reveal opportunities. This exercise is designed to show a deep understanding of people and their relation to an organization at a broad and inclusive manner, such that it enables multiple parties to deeply engage. This broad approach still provides depth but puts more focus on common understanding, collaboration and provoking conversation. The object itself is the result of a process, not a deliverable to throw over the fence (so to speak).</p>
<p>The implication of shifting our mentality may help facilitate more collaboration between researchers and clients, as well as within the client organization. It opens up space for design research to tap into more quantitative analytics like big data, merging user-focused qualitative information with more business focused measurements. It also enables design research to serve as the bridge that crosses over organizational silos, promoting inter-departmental collaboration through shared understanding and common ground.</p>
<h3 id="research-within-organizations">Research within Organizations</h3>
<p>How an organization uses and integrates design research, and more broadly qualitative data, is another approach to creating design research that can also benefit from using a framework approach. While we looked at frameworks as a way to more deeply engage stakeholders, we can also think about frameworks that enable organizations to more effectively share and use design research.</p>
<p>Cherkasky demos an interesting approach to this in his talk (all be it off screen), where an iPad application was developed for a client to capture design research and their own business metrics in a single dashboard-like interface. The intent not only serves as a boundary object to capture the user research for stakeholders, but also serves as a framework that can be added to and interacted with to create new insights that will grow over time and encourage understanding across the entire organization.</p>
<p>While I’m not sure how successful this was for the particular client, the idea that design research can be designed not as a deliverable that summarizes findings and provides insights, but serves as a tool for an organization to learn from and utilize these insights, seems like its on the right track.</p>
<p>As Cherkasky points out, organizations spend millions of dollars on frameworks to understand big data to inform business decisions, so why shouldn’t user research be treated the same way?</p>
