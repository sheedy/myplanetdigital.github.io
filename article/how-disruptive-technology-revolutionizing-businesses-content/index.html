Now before you roll your eyes, click the &#39;back&#39; button on your browser, and wonder why I even need to write a blog post about such an obvious fact, bear with me as we examine where it&#39;s come in such a short period of time.</h2>
<p>The first iteration of the world wide web was static.  Like a library full of published books, it was just another medium to put words on.  Many companies and organizations soon realized that they could reach a wide audience through this new medium; after all, between December 1995 and December 2000, the <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/emarketing.htm">number of users on the Internet</a> had grown from about 16 million to an impressive 361 million (for those of you that are keeping track, there are close to 2 billion users on the Internet today, or <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm">28.7% of the world&#39;s population</a>).  It made sense for companies, organizations, and even individuals -- it was a low cost investment and there was huge potential, right?  All that mattered was you had to &quot;be there&quot; and everything would flow from there.</p>
<p>Well, kind of.  That&#39;s what everybody thought and so the Internet exploded.  According to Google, their first index in 1998 had about 26 million webpages.  In 2000, that index had hit the 1 billion mark.  By mid-2008, approximately ten years after Google&#39;s first index, they hit a new milestone of <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/we-knew-web-was-big.html">1 trillion webpages on the Internet</a>.  Having a website for your company is no longer a question mark, it&#39;s a necessity.  However, with so many multi-purpose websites out there clamoring for people&#39;s limited time, it&#39;s not enough to just &quot;be there&quot; anymore.  In addition to being user-friendly and functional, your website also has to be relevant and engaging.</p>
<p>The capabilities and requirements for websites (perhaps better termed as &quot;online products and services&quot;) have evolved so much with buzzwords such as &quot;Web 2.0&quot;, &quot;social media&quot;, &quot;software-as-a-service&quot;, &quot;cloud computing&quot;, and &quot;mobile&quot;.  We know that these new technologies have sprung up extremely successful companies with some pretty impressive valuations (i.e. Facebook and Twitter).  While some of these companies have actually defined brand new spaces in their own right, it&#39;s easy to forget how many &quot;traditional&quot; industries have been absolutely disrupted by online technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>retail industry</strong> has been changed by e-commerce and companies such as Amazon, Dell, and eBay.  As these companies keep evolving their offerings, they penetrate further and further into the standard retail market.  For example, Amazon Prime has made it easy to get almost anything, anytime shipped to your door in two days for a low yearly cost.  The barrier to purchase low-cost items like toilet paper that might have previously been bought at the local Wal-Mart instead has now been removed.</li>
<li>The <strong>adult escort industry</strong> owes a great deal of its existence to the Internet, as explained in the CNBC documentary <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232/?video=1183761885&amp;play=1">Dirty Money: The Business of High-End Prostitution</a>.  It&#39;s not going to be the premiere case study in MBA school, but the fact is that the reach and anonymity of the Internet made this industry and the scandals it uncovers possible.</li>
<li>Apple&#39;s iTunes and Netflix have changed the way the music and video industries deliver their content.  Despite a lot of lobbying by producers and recording studios, the desire for fast access to digital content have made $0.99 songs and low monthly subscriptions to streaming movies less of the exception and more of the norm.</li>
<li>The <strong>banking industry</strong>, typically resistant to major changes (in part because of security requirements), has moved many functions to online banking websites (and are also moving to mobile as well).  While there will likely always be a need for classic brick-and-mortar banks, a lot of streamlining has already started to happen.</li>
<li>Even the <strong>publishing industry</strong> is starting to realize the need to start changing their business models, as evidenced by Rupert Murdoch&#39;s agreement with Apple to launch The Daily, an iPad newspaper that costs $0.99 a week.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#39;s important about some of these disruptions is not only the technology that revolutionizes these industries, but the <strong>business models</strong> that companies are coming up with to take advantage of the technology.  In Guy Kawasaki&#39;s &quot;The Art of the Start&quot;, he talks about the parable of the ice maker.  That is, in the late 1800s, ice harvesting companies that cut blocks of ice from frozen lakes and ponds were displaced by companies that invented mechanical ice makers.  Consequently, those ice making companies were made irrelevant by the ones that made refrigerators.  In both cases, they failed to recognize a new unknown technology as a legitimate competitor.</p>
<p>Just because an industry has not traditionally used bleeding-edge technology doesn&#39;t mean it is immune to it.  Cell phones have replaced landlines for many individuals.  Scanners and email have thankfully replaced fax machines as well.  At Myplanet, we&#39;re constantly challenging ourselves to think about new disruptive business models and how technology can be used to help our clients change the way they do business.  And I&#39;m willing to bet that we&#39;re not the only ones.  If your industry has not been affected yet, there is a good chance that it&#39;s because you don&#39;t realize it has (like the ice makers), or it will happen in the not-so-distant future. </p>
<p>Just remember, there is a significant competitive advantage to being proactive as opposed to reactive.  Just ask Blockbuster how its retail video-content delivering stores are doing (hint: they filed for bankruptcy in September 2010).</p>
