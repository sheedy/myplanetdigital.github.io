			<h2 id="in-part-three-of-this-four-part-series-yvonne-ho-shares-key-ideas-and-personal-reflections-from-her-favourite-talk-at-the-recent-designthinkers-conference-">In Part Three of this four-part series, Yvonne Ho shares key ideas and personal reflections from her favourite talk at the recent DesignThinkers Conference.</h2>
<p>Hosted by the Association of Registered Graphic Designers (RGD), the event brought together thought leaders in visual communication, creative processes and strategic design thinking.</p>
<h3 id="james-griffin-on-designing-across-multiple-platforms">James Griffin on Designing Across Multiple Platforms</h3>
<p>This year I had the privilege of attending Design Thinkers 2013 as part of the Myplanet crew. Over this two-day event, I participated in lectures, sessions, and events held by fellow design-driven creatives from all around the world. I had never attended DT before, but I had been given raving reviews from my peers in the past. Some were typical low-key reviews, “You will love meeting like-minded people”, others were more exuberant, “Your life will be changed! I don’t look at design the same way anymore!” Needless to say, I was pretty excited to attend. With a week’s reflection, I can safely say that my life hasn’t really changed nor has my perspective on design. But that doesn’t mean I didn’t benefit from this conference--as the saying goes, you get what you put in.
If I attended Design Thinkers with the expectation of sitting in a lecture to soak in design wisdom from creative geniuses, I would probably walk away disappointed. As inspiring as the speakers were, my favourite and most insightful moments were the opportunities to talk and engage with my peers and the speakers.</p>
<p>One such session was James Griffin’s Designing across Multiple Platforms. James is the head of mobile design of Eikon mobile for Thomson Reuters. In his talk, he discussed the challenges his small team of 10 designers initially faced in a demanding, team silo-ed environment. From inadequate tools and facilities to a lack of design value across teams, the product was suffering and the design team felt that they had low impact. James discussed how they were able to change the organizational mindset from a set of requirements to an all encompassing journey and experience. They made team changes so that the product was not just owned by one silo, they integrated usability testing, and spearheaded the initiative to define a consistent design voice and identity.</p>
<p>Watch the <a href="http://player.vimeo.com/video/66069977">promo video</a> of Thomson Reuters Eikon in action.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the allotted time slots given to the speakers often cause them to gloss over the details and simply discuss high level wins and losses. Luckily, James was kind enough to stay and answer questions. It was during this time that I got the chance to dig deeper and ask about the issues that I found truly interesting and relevant: How did their designers integrate with their development teams (especially the remote teams)? How did they integrate user testing? What are their next steps? What does designing across multiple platforms mean for his team?</p>
<p>In this question period, James brought up granular examples of Eikon’s devotion to creating a truly thoughtful approach across different devices. A design working on multiple platforms usually mean desktop, tablet, and “most” mobile devices. However, James’s team wanted the ideal user experience regardless of device: touch screen androids, scrolling blackberrys, and taller, high resolution iphone screens. They were willing to put in the time to research and evaluate proper placement of back buttons, situation and context based needs, interface changes based on resolution, etc. It was clear from the detail that James was speaking from real experience and actual weeks were spent mulling over these problems.</p>
<p>For me, it was inspiring to hear about the “less visible” hard work that goes into a product and how a team could identify problems and tackle them together. So while I may not have had my design philosophy turned upside down, Design Thinkers gave me the opportunity to meet talented people like James Griffin who remind you that design is about problem solving and that we shouldn’t “underestimate the power of our craft”.</p>
