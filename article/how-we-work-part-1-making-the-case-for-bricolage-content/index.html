<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Agile purists, human-centered advocates, lean UXers. Manifestos, credos, value-laden proclamations. In UX design and development circles, there’s certainly no shortage of opinion when it comes to the ideal process for building a successful digital product. Relativist arguments and trump cards abound (“if you had to modify the method, you’re doing it wrong;” “the rules require that you abandon all rules”; “it’s not true x or y”). Yet, does the dogmatic prescription of one, true method really facilitate the creation of a meaningful user experience in a professional services context? What does Agile look like outside of software product development and where do the rules need to bend to serve clients effectively? This series examines the ways in which our process has evolved to support our clients, staff, and quality of work, arguing collectively that a process “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricolage">bricolage</a>” is critical to creating amazing digital products.</p>
<h3 id="making-the-case-for-bricolage">Making the case for bricolage</h3>
<p>When it comes to designing and building digital products, five to seven heads—each with an approach unique to its discipline—are better than one. Yes, we’re aware of the potential impacts of groupthink, and as designers and developers we’ve all attended at least one brainstorming session that was more unproductive debate than creative revelation. But at its core, the idea that a diversity of perspectives can lead to a more interesting, creative, or innovative idea is relatively pedestrian.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Interdisciplinary” is quickly becoming a buzz phrase in our industry, but with good, substantiated reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve always maintained that this logic should apply universally. Picking and choosing and combining and remixing the best parts with different perspectives—what the Ivory Tower might call “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricolage">bricolage</a>”—seems like a logical way to approach a problem, be it mashing up James Brown and the Beastie Boys or developing a process for building digital products. When it comes to the latter, there are so many methodologies that build in mechanisms for collaborative, iterative, interdisciplinary, and lateral problem-solving. But how open are practitioners to modifying these frameworks themselves? </p>
<p>Despite the use-what-works, collaborative spirit of methodologies like Agile, I’ve encountered more than a few organizations, teams, and individuals who seem wholly opposed to the idea of adapting or modifying their methodology from its ‘pure’ form, as prescribed in a manifesto of sorts. The mere reference to a “manifesto,” of course, should immediately raise eyebrows. Manifestos are valuable. They harden a set of perspectives and can galvanize a movement. They’re a great tool for understanding and aligning value systems. But the dogmatic and normative language of manifestos can be dangerous: We needn’t look further than religious texts, political proclamations, or agency brand guides (please, please stop imposing print standards on the web!) to see the impact of fundamentalist interpretation. When we elevate a manifesto to the level of metanarrative—the grand, totalizing story used to explain the world, no debate necessary—we can lose sight of the intention of the words and fall into the habit of applying method blindly (sometimes undermining the original intent altogether).</p>
<p>Overly dramatic? Probably. After all, Agile purists aren’t likely planning any Soviet-era interrogations of Scrum dissidents. But in the context of professional services user experience design, this dogmatism is not merely ironic and paradoxical (asserting rules about breaking rules), but potentially detrimental since many frameworks, like Agile, were envisioned in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Suitability">different context</a>. </p>
<p>There are different parameters for different business models: We consider ourselves an Agile organization, and we use Agile. Maximizing flexibility and minimizing waste are core to our approach. But as a services organization, when we work with clients, we are already always bastardizing the “pure” approach to Agile (in particular, Scrum) since external stakeholders add variability around the product. Approval times and the layers of decisionmaking in enterprise organizations are just two of the service peculiarities that we can’t simply discount as “not Agile.” Our product introduces confounding factors as well. As I’m <a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/bringing-user-centered-design-to-the-agile-environment/">definitely not the first to suggest</a>, just getting into it without a comprehensive, more holistic view of the emotional, experiential continuity necessary to build a unified UX system isn’t always viable for a corporate website where fixed time &amp; budget are limited and brand equity is riding on the quality of the first release. If we didn’t modify things a bit, the process would feel like trying to film and release a movie in iterations without an overarching understanding of the plotline. </p>
<p>Of course, there are also many challenges associated with alternative methodologies on the spectrum from predictive to adaptive processes. For example, at the far predictive end, the waterfall approach is notoriously <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model#Criticism">wasteful and inflexible</a> when applied to building digital products. But the intention of waterfall, where it involves comfort and certainty for our clients, is not something to simply ignore. </p>
<p>As process “bricoleurs,” we believe that the benefits of being flexible when it comes to problem-solving for our products should also carry through to determining how we might approach our work. If we’re going to be agile, let’s do it across the board. We evolve our strategy and tactics constantly by pulling ideas and concepts from various schools of thought. We’ve made a commitment to always give a new process a chance before we adapt it—we’re totally on the Agile bandwagon—but we’re not afraid to modify prescribed approaches where we need to.</p>
<p>This series examines how, as a growing UX proservices company, we’ve intermingled the best of various frameworks to grapple with new challenges unique to our business model and product. In the next article I’ll examine some of the results of our process bricolage, specifically the roles our team members play and the methodologies these roles stem from. And, following that, I’ll review some of the strategic and tactical process elements we’re currently using to get a project from initial idea to working product. But let’s start the discussion here. How do you approach process for building great user experiences?</p>
