<h3 id="we-are-relentless-in-uncovering-user-truth-">We are relentless in uncovering user truth.</h3>
<p>Building a successful, innovative web application that people actually want to use is hard—damn hard. When it comes to choosing what to build and how to build it, many enterprise teams rely on the wisdom and assumptions of business or IT. Left unvalidated, these “inside-out” assumptions can compound and lead to the wrong product. By adopting a user-centered, “outside-in” approach, we obsessively examine and test these assumptions in the real world to validate problems, solutions, and architecture.</p>

<p>To successfully launch and scale a product in a highly competitive and changing environment, getting to market quickly and with minimum waste is critical. The golden age of extensive upfront specification is over—if it ever was golden—and modern web product teams must be agile, iterative, and nimble. Our teams are performance-tuned to pivot efficiently when new business, customer, and technical constraints arise. We apply automation and a development operations approach that drastically reduce cycle time from code to deployment. </p>
