<p>Humbly beginning with five guys stuffed in a 500 square foot office in downtown Toronto, our team has grown to over 90 today (and rising!). Firm believers in the power of great user experiences to create meaning in people’s lives, outspoken champions of open source, practitioners of agile from top to bottom - these are but a few characteristics of the Myplaneteer. We’ve applied our philosophy at some of the biggest companies in the world and the most interesting nonprofits. But hey, we’re not bragging - we just love what we do!</p>

<p><i>Just ask some of these guys we’ve worked with…</i></p>
<p><img src="/associated-files/article/what-we-do/logos.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="most-enterprises-use-a-business-or-it-driven-inside-out-approach-for-disruptive-or-innovative-products-we-think-it-s-risky-">Most enterprises use a business- or IT-driven inside-out approach.  For disruptive or innovative products, we think it’s risky.</h3>
<p><img src="/associated-files/article/what-we-do/the-risk.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We believe the right product should  be user experience (UX) driven. <strong>It’s outside in, not inside out.</strong> The outside-in approach acknowledges that there  is a gap between declared vs. revealed needs.</p>
<p>Declared needs create assumptions.  If left unvalidated, the wrong product gets built. The goal of an outside-in approach is to test assumptions and reveal validated problems, solutions, and architecture.</p>
<p><img src="/associated-files/article/what-we-do/1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="utility">Utility</h3>
<p><strong>Assumption:</strong> A problem exists and we need to solve it.</p>
<p><img src="/associated-files/article/what-we-do/down-arrow.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Validation:</strong> Does the problem really exist? Is there a demand for the soltuion?</p>
<p><img src="/associated-files/article/what-we-do/2s.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="usability">Usability</h3>
<p><strong>Assumption:</strong> Our solution to the problem is the most effective way.</p>
<p><img src="/associated-files/article/what-we-do/down-arrow.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Validation:</strong> How many potential solutions have you tested? How does it comapre to the competition?</p>
<p><img src="/associated-files/article/what-we-do/3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="feasability">Feasability</h3>
<p><strong>Assumption:</strong> We&#39;ve built the right architeture for our solution.</p>
<p><img src="/associated-files/article/what-we-do/down-arrow.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Validation:</strong> Do you have a clear sense of the desired user experience? Do you have the right skill sets to built it?</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-build-the-right-products-outside-in-and-fast-">How do we build the right products outside-in and fast?</h2>
<h3 id="we-are-relentless-in-uncovering-user-truth">We Are Relentless in Uncovering User Truth</h3>
<p>That means we&#39;re kind of obsessed with understanding what users really want. We use an immersive user validation process that is a combination of  user-centered design thinking and lean validation processes,  designed to help organizations to avoid the  trap of in-the-box-thinking and instead, encourage the exploration of new opportunities of thought to get it right the first time. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User-Centered Design:</strong> Because we&#39;re always thinking about the user, we are seriously disciplined in our approach of how we uncover, prioritize and solve for actual user needs. Attention to detail matters. In each detail lies the potential to delight, to inspire, and to impact. That, to us, is all the meaning in the world. They win. You win. We all win</li>
<li><strong>Lean Validation Approaches:</strong> We believe that the leaner we are in how we go about our methods of understanding the user, makes us better by focusing through a customer-lens framework, that validates any internal business assumptions and product hypotheses . We do this very well</li>
</ol>
<p>We see 2x to 3x time to market improvements. Believe it. 
And we show customers how to do it…</p>
<h3 id="rapid-product-development">Rapid Product Development</h3>
<p>We&#39;re pretty fast. The way we operate and set up our teams, allows us to deliver more rapidly without compromising quality to the most demanding customer. Enterprises today, more than ever face more pressure to deliver timely, on-target products and an increasingly need for speed to-market in order to compete in a world of changing innovations. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agile Team Structure</strong>
Our cross-disciplinary teams work in super agile fashion, reducing inefficiencies across the board allowing us to be quickly adaptable when business needs change. We love and trust agile thinking and we live and breathe these principles daily in how we work together and with our customers as part of our key values.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlined Delivery</strong>
We like to automate certain processes in our development phases. This means we can focus on improving product quality, respond faster to changes all while drastically reducing cycle time from code to deployment. Businesses really like this about us.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-real-power-in-empowerment-is-your-people-we-can-help-">The real power in empowerment is your people. We can help.</h2>
<h3 id="enterprise-empowerment">Enterprise Empowerment</h3>
<p>We believe our customers and their teams, need to feel enabled and empowered when they work with us. Also being highly flexible on how customers want us to engage with them and their current team structures is something we highly value. Today, organizations are not only in need of augmented expertise in just services, but also require repeatable, and sustainable practices of these investments for the future. We believe Enterprises cannot be empowered without equally empowered people. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flexible Engagement Models:</strong> We&#39;ve got multiple ways of how we can work with organizations. This works well because we can seamlessly integrate at any stage of their product and service lifecycle. (Accelerator, Shoulder-to-Shoulder, Joint Venture). <need each of these 3 things hyperlinked to some visual explaining in detail> Our customers highly value our flexibility on the various ways we can fit into their 
existing world and needs.  </li>
<li><strong>Inclusive Collaboration:</strong> Our clients get involved. They love our direct and collaborative ways we work together that support better decision making. This is very much part of our agile thinking on how we should work together as a collective.</li>
<li><strong>Enablement:</strong> Ensuring your teams are well equipped and strongly knowledged in new capabilities is a key element in how we empower organizational teams and stretch their investments further. Capacity and capability building that supports or enhances Enterprise teams is an important part of driving repeatable and ongoing success.</li>
