<p>While our Fellowship program welcomes college and university students, World of Webcraft aims to attract junior developers and freelancers who are early in their web careers. </p>
<p>For the first month of Webcraft, participants will learn the basics of the Myplanet development process and project lifecycle. Using Drupal as our content management platform, hands-on exercises and challenges in class will deliver a thorough understanding of this open source framework. </p>
<p>Beyond the first month, learners who exhibit a solid grasp of the concepts may be invited to take part in the &quot;play &amp; earn&quot; phase for the remaining 8 weeks of the program. They&#39;ll work on real client tasks that will support Myplanet production teams and will be compensated for their work. It&#39;s an unparalleled opportunity gain first-hand, paid development experience with the guidance of skilled mentors. </p>
<p>Webcraft classes will take place on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9AM-5PM at our brand spankin&#39; new office downtown Toronto. Successful completion of the program could lead to a full-time employment opportunity at Myplanet.</p>
<p>Weâ€™re incredibly excited to launch World of Webcraft in January with 15 web lovin&#39; participants. If you&#39;re interested in learning more about the program, visit the Webcraft website or get in touch with webcraft@myplanetdigital.com. </p>
