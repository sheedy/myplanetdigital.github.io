With over $1 billion in annual revenue, Mitel needed to have a web prescence that was truly reflective of their powerhouse brand.</h2>

<p>Before Myplanet was approached by Mitel, their existing website was slow, making it hard to keep a low bounce rate and capture user attention. For a company that prides itself on providing unifed communications across multiple platforms, the back-end archeticture of their website was surprisingly clunky, making it difficult to update and manage content. With a company that has over <strong>60 million</strong> customers worldwide (and growing), they needed an option that was flexible and able to adapt to a number of needs from a growing brand.</p>
<h3 id="defining-over-arching-problems-and-challenges">Defining over-arching problems and challenges</h3>
<p>Working closely with Mitel stakeholders, we sysnthesized a list of design problems that needed to be addressed for a successful product delivery:
<em>Propel Mitel to the forefront of the industry in thought leadership.
</em>Increase visitor retention by reducing bounce rate.
<em>Increase visibility to channel partners and provide high quality product information.
</em>Create a unified brand experience.</p>
<p>First step was to create a visual design direction that still followed Mitel&#39;s brand guidelines. </p>

<h3 id="pivoting-our-approach">Pivoting our approach</h3>
<p>Even though our designs looked great, we had to dig deep to discover the root problem. Why were users confused about where to find product information? What design decisions were hindering the interactivity and discoverability that is needed for a successful redesign?</p>
<h3 id="understanding-real-user-intentions">Understanding real user intentions</h3>
<p>Absorbing Mitel&#39;s transition in direction, Myplanet was able to test with real users and recieve feedback that eliminated wasted effort and reduced inefficiencies within our teams - producing a desirable outcome with some staggering increases in analytics. </p>
<p>To faciliate the exploration of the website, we needed to recreate an ideal experience for first-time visitors. By testing over a dozen conepts, we were able to validate the most effective solution that generated leads to certain sections of the site by a <strong>fourfold increase</strong>. Usabilit test revealed that Myplanet&#39;s optimal site structure improved page requests by 100%, which was a direct result of consolidating multiple consumer facing functions. At 4.48 seconds, the new website loads twice as fast, therefore, improving the bounce rate by 22%.</p>

<p>Myplanet and Mitel&#39;s collaborative relationship allowed for rapid development and enabled the project to accomodate large pivot with relative ease. </p>
