With over $1 billion in annual revenue, Mitel needed to have a web prescence that was truly reflective of their powerhouse brand.</h2>

<p>Before Myplanet was approached by Mitel, their existing website was slow, making it hard to keep a low bounce rate and capture user attention. For a company that prides itself on providing unifed communications across multiple platforms, the back-end archeticture of their website was surprisingly clunky, making it difficult to update and manage content. With a company that has over <strong>60 million</strong> customers worldwide (and growing), they needed an option that was flexible and able to adapt to a number of needs from a growing brand.</p>
<h3 id="defining-over-arching-problems-and-challenges">Defining over-arching problems and challenges</h3>
<p>Working closely with Mitel stakeholders, we sysnthesized a list of design problems that needed to be addressed for a successful product delivery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Propel Mitel to the forefront of the industry in thought leadership.</li>
<li>Increase visitor retention by reducing bounce rate.</li>
<li>Increase visibility to channel partners and provide high quality product information.</li>
<li>Create a unified brand experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="understanding-real-user-intentions">Understanding real user intentions</h3>
<p>Absorbing Mitel&#39;s transition in direction, Myplanet was able to test with real users and recieve feedback that eliminated wasted effort and reduced inefficiencies within our teams - producing a desirable outcome with some staggering increases in analytics. </p>
<p>To faciliate the exploration of the website, we needed to recreate an ideal experience for first-time visitors. By testing over a dozen conepts, we were able to validate the most effective solution that generated leads to certain sections of the site by a <strong>fourfold increase</strong>. Usability tests revealed that Myplanet&#39;s optimal site structure improved page requests by 100%, which was a direct result of consolidating multiple consumer facing functions. At 4.48 seconds, the new website loads twice as fast, therefore, improving the bounce rate by 22%.</p>

<p>Myplanet and Mitel&#39;s collaborative relationship allowed for rapid development and enabled the project to accomodate large pivot with relative ease. </p>
