With over $1 billion in annual revenue, Mitel needed to have a web prescence that was truly reflective of their powerhouse brand.</h2>

<p>Before Myplanet was approached by Mitel, their existing website was slow, making it hard to keep a low bounce rate and capture user attention. For a company that prides itself on providing unifed communications across multiple platforms, the back-end archeticture of their website was surprisingly clunky, making it difficult to update and manage content. With a company that has over 60 million customers worldwide (and growing), they needed an option that was flexible and able to adapt to a number of needs from a growing brand.</p>
<h3 id="defining-over-arching-problems-and-challenges-">Defining over-arching problems and challenges:</h3>
<p>Working closely with Mitel stakeholders, we sysnthesized a list of design problems that needed to be addressed for a successful product delivery:</p>
<div class="image" style="width:50%; float:left;"><img src="/associated-files/article/mitel/1.png" alt=""></div>Propel Mitel to the forefront of the industry in thought leadership.
<div class="image" style="width:50%; float:left;"><img src="/associated-files/article/mitel/2.png" alt=""></div>Increase visitor retention by reducing bounce rate.
<div class="image" style="width:50%; float:left;"><img src="/associated-files/article/mitel/3.png" alt=""></div>Increase visibility to channel partners and provide high quality product information.
<div class="image" style="width:50%; float:left;"><img src="/associated-files/article/mitel/4.png" alt=""></div>Create a unified brand experience.

First step was to create a visual design direction that still followed Mitel&#39;s brand guidelines. With a lot of issues surrounding Mitel&#39;s existing website, we had to dig deep to the root of the problem.

<h3 id="pivoting-our-approach">Pivoting Our Approach</h3>
<p>Even though our designs looked great, we had to dig deep to discover the root problem.</p>
<p> The way we worked with Mitel absorbed this transition in fdirection with little inefficienci, and we were able to test with real users to receive real-world feedback. </p>
<p>Next steps:
Understand users real desires and wants to faciliate the exploration of content </p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>By testing over a dozen conepts, we were able to validate the most effective solution that created leads to certain sections of the site by a fourfold increase. As we con</p>
<p>By conducting usability tests, we were able to build an optional site archectiure that imporved page request response rate by 100%. By validating the consolidation of Mitel&#39;s multiple consumer facing functions - coroprate website,blogs, channel partner serch iutility, and Marketo&#39;s lead tracking web forms, we were abl to improve visitor retention
At 4.48 seconds the new website loads almost twice as fast compared to the old website. Bounce rate improved by 22%.</p>

<p>We build the right thing, fast. By pivots throughout the project, we were able to validate the right soltuoion that fit Mitel&#39;s solution. This collaborative relationship allowed for rapid development and enabled the project to accomodate large pivot with relative ease. </p>
