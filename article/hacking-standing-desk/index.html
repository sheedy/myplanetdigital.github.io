			<h2 id="many-of-my-colleagues-use-standing-desks-in-our-markham-office-i-wanted-to-bring-that-same-experience-to-my-home-office-in-vancouver-">Many of my colleagues use standing desks in our Markham office. I wanted to bring that same experience to my home office in Vancouver.</h2>
<p>In the past several years there have appeared a number of articles published claiming that working while standing is better for one&#39;s health than sitting. I spend quite a bit of my spare time perfecting my ballroom dancing, so paying attention to posture and listening to my body is something that is important to me. And my body was starting to tell me that sitting in front of a computer monitor all day was not so great.</p>
<p>Since I had just moved and was still tweaking my office setup, I thought I&#39;d use the opportunity to build myself a standing desk.  I discovered this somewhat famous article that provides instructions for building an inexpensive standing desk from IKEA components. This was the starting point for my project - but I made a number of modifications.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="/associated-files/article/hacking-standing-desk/body_1.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>First, I realized that I&#39;d need to build the double wide model to accommodate the monitor set up I had in mind, and I had plenty of space on my current desk top. After looking at various options at IKEA, I decided that I would extend the keyboard shelf across the entire width of the double table arrangement.  None of the pre-finished shelves available were the correct width, so I went with the Ekby Tryggve model, which is a 1/2&quot; thick unfinished laminated pine shelf, and cut it to length.</p>
<p>Various comments on the original post suggested using bolts to fasten the shelf supports, and I followed this advice.  Instead of going with the 3&quot; bolts suggested, I used 2 1/2&quot; bolts and countersunk the heads by about .25&quot;.  This prevents the bolts from sticking out more than necessary at the back of the table leg.  Another approach, perhaps more sophisticated, would be to use 2-1/2&quot; Chicago fasteners (aka bindery bolts).</p>
<div class="image"><img src="/associated-files/article/hacking-standing-desk/body_2.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>Countersinking the mount holes was by far the trickiest aspect of the assembly - I&#39;d suggest this approach only if you have access to a drill press, a good depth stop for your drill, or very good nerves and a steady hand.  I got a set of seven imperial size depth stops from Lee Valley for under $10. Lee Valley is also a great source if you are looking for self-leveling glides and other hardware for making the various parts of the unit more adjustable.</p>
<p>Using the unfinished pine shelf meant that I had some choice in how to finish it, and I went with a quite dark reddish finish (Minwax #273 - Gunstock) which is similar to antique cherry wood, and finished the shelf with a Tung oil reactive finish which I use on a lot of my woodworking projects.</p>
<p>One thing that was very much stressed by a follow-up to the original post was the importance of getting an anti-fatigue mat. I was happy to discover that Lee Valley a comfortable, high-quality alternative to the item source in the article: they stock a 27&quot; x 60&quot; closed cell bench mat for approx $40.</p>
<h3 id="a-couple-of-tips-tricks-">A couple of tips/tricks:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Insert push-pins into the ends (and maybe bottom side) of the shelf prior to staining / finishing. This will give you something to pick the piece up with while it&#39;s drying, and the finish (and your surroundings) won&#39;t be harmed from contact with the bench/floor/walls.</li>
<li>If your need to fasten the shelf supports near the top of the table legs, remember that there is a fastener that runs through the center of the leg near the top and offset your shelf support mounting hole accordingly.</li>
<li>I fastened the two pairs of inside legs together with a couple of 1 1/2&quot; long steel plates to give the unit some structural integrity.</li>
<li>The holes for the countersunk screws can be capped with small plugs which give the entire project a more finished appearance.</li>
<li>I used a pair of sturdy clamps to fasten the shelf supports to the table while I was getting the height adjustment right. Have a look at the original IKEA desk article for hints on this.  It&#39;s a good idea to wear the footwear you normally do while working.</li>
</ul>
<div class="image"><img src="/associated-files/article/hacking-standing-desk/body_3.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>The whole project, including the trip to IKEA and the application of two coats of stain, took up a lazy Saturday. Have fun, and happy hacking.</p>
