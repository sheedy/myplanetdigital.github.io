    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>I&#39;m the perpetual optimist. That means everything and anything can get, and will, be better. I love to dream. I believe in possibilities. Yeah, I&#39;m that person.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>As the Marketing Director for Myplanet, I think about the many possibilities to reach and tell our great stories to customers. I get inspired through truth but with empathy, and I like the modern idea that the 4 marketing P&#39;s are really about Principals, Purpose, Perception, and People! I am surrounded here by talented individuals and ideas that fuels my passion to further our goals.</p>
