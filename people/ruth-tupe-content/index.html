<p>I&#39;m all about realising creative and people potential. With my background in design and HR, I&#39;m interested in designing peopleâ€™s experiences, in order to foster more productive and positive work relationships. I&#39;m interested in nurturing team dynamics, mentoring personal development, and creating a culture of learning.</p>
<p>On a side note, I have a strong interest in politics, world issues, history, philosophy, and music. I also a foodie and a coffee addict, both of which fuel my creative energy.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>It&#39;s exciting to identify and develop talent and have had my hand in recruiting in the past year. I&#39;m proud to be a part of building the talented roster at Myplanet and helping the company grow. I enjoy identifying needs and developing processes to support and sustain the talented folks here.</p>
<p>My current focus at Myplanet is to develop people potential and to create a culture of learning. Being a part of team Eduardo, we offer educational initiatives within and outside the Myplanet sphere. The goal is to train others on our practices and methodologies and to foster multi-disciplinary learning.</p>
