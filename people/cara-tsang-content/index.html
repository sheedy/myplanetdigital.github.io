    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>I have a boundless curiosity about what makes people tick. This interest led me deep into the world of Cognitive Psychology, where I spent years fiddling with eye-trackers and testing human guinea pigs young and old to discover how they understand language. </p>
<p>After dealing with one (dozen...) too many frustrating UI&#39;s, I was inspired to leave the ivory towers and use my research powers for the greater good: To help create products that result in intuitive, elegant, and engaging user experiences. </p>
<p>The Maillard Reaction, the interwebs, pop jazz, improv ... these are a few of my favourite things. I also enjoys long walks on the beach, but only if they lead to cheese or bacon.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I try to get inside people&#39;s heads! I dig into users&#39; beliefs, attitudes, needs, and goals, and then use that to figure out how to build the best thing for them. And then I show that thing to more users, and see if it breaks. Lather, rinse, repeat, love.</p>
<p>I also make a lot of terrible puns, attend a lot of office Fiestas, and drink an entirely reasonable amount of beer on Beer Fridays.</p>
