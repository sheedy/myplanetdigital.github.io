    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>Anyone who knows me long enough knows I like strategies. I call them theories, of course! Be it finding the shortest workout (right now I think it&#39;s around 3.5 minutes), how to get top hotel status in 8 weeks, using long line theory to pick a new restaurant, or transform an organization to be more agile quickly. If I end up doing something long enough, you can bet my mind has concocted some theory about it. Let&#39;s chat about it sometime if you&#39;re interested.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I sit in a fun role that straddles the front and back end of our services business - working hard to keep the gap between what we offer and how we deliver it as closed as possible across the organization.</p>
