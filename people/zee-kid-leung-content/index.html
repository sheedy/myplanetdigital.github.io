    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>I&#39;m a Torontonian that fell in love with the power of photography to create stories and express a point of view. Iâ€™m also an analyst that uses numbers to pose and answer questions about the world around us.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I help remove obstacles as a Scrum Master on the Strategy and Support Group. I help the team to work towards their goals by making sure that they have all the tools required to do their job, hiding distractions and acting as a gatekeeper.  I also enable the team to understand their progress by reporting on capacity and velocity.</p>
