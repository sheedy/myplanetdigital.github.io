    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>My passion is human performance and applying leading methods to bring people closer together and to their peak potential. As a child I strived to become Indiana Jones and am a full-on adventurer at heart. I&#39;ve  trekked almost every country in Asia and spend my free time on retreat in the Himalaya&#39;s. I&#39;ve been bitten by monkey&#39;s, fallen off of cliffs and have growled back at a wild Tiger during a harrowing jungle trek...</p>
<p>After extensive expeditions throughout the Far East (and after a bit of time launching three of my own start-ups, working for one of the worlds top PR &amp; Marketing firms and studying Business Management and Organizational Studies at Western University), I joined Myplanet 3 1/2 years ago as Team and Talent Development Lead.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I am a certified emotional intelligence coach and team collaboration specialist. I&#39;m also Senior Faculty and Co-ordinator for the Mind@Work and Mindful Leadership programs at University of Toronto where I teach mindfulness-based emotional intelligence for performance and team collaboration. I&#39;m founder of University Health Networks Mindfulness for Leadership and Resiliency program serving 10,000+ healthcare professionals and at the end of it all, simply love the culture we&#39;ve created at Myplanet!</p>
