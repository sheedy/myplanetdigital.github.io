    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>I&#39;m Charlie. I love pushing boundaries and making new things. I&#39;m a big fan of technology, and using it to empower people.  I have a degree in Knowledge Integration and Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, where my research focused on interactive digital design. When I&#39;m not busy working on new product concepts, you can usually find me gallivanting around a far-flung continent, or waist-deep in backcountry powder on my snowboard.  </p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>Here at Myplanet, I&#39;m currently tasked with product strategy and execution for Relay Robin (www.relayrobin.com), our new suite of video-conferencing tools.  I work closely with our carrier partners, end-users, designers, and developers to make our products the best they can possibly be. I have also worked as an agile Product Owner on our prototyping team, creating functional prototypes of next-generation cloud data center management tools.</p>
