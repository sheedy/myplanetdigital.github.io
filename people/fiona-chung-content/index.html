    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>As a creative lead, I find myself passionate about design in all shapes and sizes from visual-interactive, interaction design to user research. I am a geek for gaining those nuggets of user insights that transforms a good product into one that carries deep impact in its final execution. When not being a full-time creative, Iâ€™m also a part-time traveller, a self-proclaimed film critic and an avid linguaphile.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>My mission at Myplanet is to create digital products with the greatest impact possible. I value impact in three ways: User Impact, Creative Impact and Community Impact. I pride myself on doing work that enriches the lives of users, while also enhancing the mastery of my craft and contributing towards a more sustainable industry at large.</p>
