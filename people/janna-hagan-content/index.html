    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>I am a user interface designer originally from Edmonton, Alberta. After graduating college, I went on to pursue my freelance career, which included clients such as the American National Breast Cancer Foundation. Even though I love to spend most of my time behind a computer screen, I&#39;ve been playing competitive basketball and softball since I was 5, and love to practice yoga.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I am responsible for organizing and maintaining consistency throughout the Myplanet brand. I love mixing the opportunities of marketing and the creativity of design to provide meaningful and structured communications to our clients and the community.</p>
