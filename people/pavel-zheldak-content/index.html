    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I Am</h2>
<p>Hello there! I am Pavel and I am Myplanet team member from Ukraine. I graduated from Chernihiv State Technological University and have Master’s degree in Special Computer Systems. I am always looking for an opportunity to create something modern and useful. This led me to the computer industry. The first site I created was with a group of friends, and that was enough to interest me in web development. I became a member of the Aсropolium team and a year later - Myplanet.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>When I first started working with Myplanet I was on the Strategy and Support team working as a Drupal developer. My current role on one of Myplanet&#39;s production teams involves backend and front-end development. I enjoy working with js-frontend interaction design and working through new challenges.</p>
