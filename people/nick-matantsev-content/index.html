    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>I am an entrepreneur at heart, with a very broad technical background. I love geeking out about everything - coffee, TV shows, pixel art, Javascript frameworks, Lego, music. I have sailed across Lake Huron, made 3D games, brewed a decent ca phe sua nong and braved black diamond runs on my snowboard.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I architect and build new enterprise products that put the user first. That means I champion usability and product delight, interact with the customer executive and help groom solid code to build things better and quicker. I also know way too much about IE CSS compatibility hacks.</p>
