    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>An idealist who believes that design has the power to influence and inspire change. I studied at the York University-Sheridan College Joint Program in Design, and enjoy creating beautifully useful things that are infused with warmth and personality. When I&#39;m not designing, I like to marathon seasons of television (especially dark and raw sci-fi), consume <em>literal</em> bowls of tea, and read big books under comfy blankets.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I aim to emphasize the positive social impact of digital products by mastering my craft, building empathy with users, and pursuing surprise and delight in everything that I create.</p>
