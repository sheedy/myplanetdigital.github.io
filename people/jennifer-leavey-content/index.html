<p>At work I am a results-driven project management professional with over 14 years experience in the technology industry, directing full cycles for complex projects and initiatives. By combining strategic and project management skills I am focused on client and team interactions that invoke process development, training, coaching and evaluation. â€¦ As you can tell, I&#39;m REALLY SERIOUS.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>As a Product Owner at Myplanet my role is to drive the Product Vision and manage the product backlog for each initiative. I work hand-in-hand with the client to ensure that the product delivered is valuable, on-time and on-budget. I also help guide our strategic direction as a company, helping to set priorities about where we&#39;re heading over the next few years and how we can plan for it.</p>
