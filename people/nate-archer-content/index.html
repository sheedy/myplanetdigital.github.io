    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>Born in Toronto, I studied industrial design in my hometown as well as in Amsterdam. I worked in Milan before coming back to Toronto to join Myplanet in 2011. Some know me to have a strange sense of humour, drink black coffee and I ride my bike in the winter.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I am a thinker and doer who believes in designing the change you wish to see in the world. I spend my days conducting design research, synthesizing findings and designing interactions for great digital products. I am passionate about solving wicked problems and advocating for user centered design.</p>
