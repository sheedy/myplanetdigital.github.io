    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>My name is Yuriy Savenko, but I&#39;m better known as Yoshi. I was born and grew up in Ukraine, in a small city of Chernihiv. In Ukraine I studied Computer Science, Art and Economics. Over the last 10 years I have founded different IT teams and companies and continue to learn and improve my hard skills as a specialist. Throughout my career, I have worn a lot of different hats; developer, designer and businessman. My credo is: you can understand other people much better after you try to live their lives. </p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I am frontend developer and Creative lead at Myplanet. I am also a remote buddy for our team back in Ukraine - trying to keep remote guys connected, informed and motivated.</p>
