    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>After completing engineering in computer science, I moved to Toronto from Dubai looking to make my mark. As any ambitious youngster, I was in search for an opportunity that would allow me to utilize my skills effectively and lay foundations to a modest career. I&#39;ve always had an interest in Technology and turning this fascination to a long term pursuit is a decision I am proud of. </p>
<p>Apart from technology, I have a huge passion for Cricket and enjoy getting out there for a game myself now and then.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>At Myplanet, I work as a QA Analyst. As a member of an agile team, I work closely with the developers to provide meaningful evaluation of ongoing work. Off the job, I enjoy learning new technologies and keep myself updated. I strongly believe that staying updated with new trends and developments is key to being successful.</p>
