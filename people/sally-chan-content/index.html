    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>I moved to Toronto from Vancouver to study industrial and graphic design, and I continue to find new interest in other disciplines. With an appetite for big ideas and an eye for small details, I believe in design&#39;s ability to impact social behaviours in delightful and powerful ways. But beware, I am also known for laughing at my own jokes, but ruining your&#39;s by asking you to explain them.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>As a designer at Myplanet, I usually can be found conducting user research, translating insights and visually communicating solutions to problems that are complex and broad in scope. What I find the most challenging and exciting is helping guide multidisciplinary teams to make informed decisions by focusing on human-centred design methodologies.</p>
