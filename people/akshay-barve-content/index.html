    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>I am a QA geek at heart who believes &#39;Quality is built-in&#39; and it needs to be improved with every new iteration of software. I like to play with new applications and find faults early in the development stage, to ensure the product or application being shipped has been verified for quality. Automated testing is something which fascinates me and makes my job really enjoyable. </p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>As part of an agile team I work with developers, product owners and stakeholders throughout the project process to promote and ensure quality. I help to create test plans and test cases while facilitating automated testing and I report any defects while ensuring there is proper followup for issue resolution. In addition to working on my team, I closely collaborate with other QAs to ensure our practices are carried throughout the organization.</p>
