    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>At any point in time, I&#39;m some combination of programmer, mathematician, pianist, dancer, reader, writer...  I live in Vancouver, Canada. My first contribution to open source software was a bug fix for the video driver in Minix, one of the precursors to Linux. I&#39;m the co-author of a book which is currently at #302,976 on the Amazon best seller list.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I write software in a variety of environments and languages.  Some of this is directly user-facing; some is used to support the development process, in testing, continuous deployment, and analysis.</p>
