    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>I recently moved to Toronto from the Ukraine to work with Myplanet. It was in Ukraine that I studied industrial electronics in State Technological University.  My interest in internet and web technologies developed while I was pursing a career in design and decided to create my own website. The unexpected joy and delight I was getting from learning web, made me forget the real reason I was developing the website.  </p>
<p>The aspect of web development that I enjoy most, is the instant gratification it gives me. In many cases I see the result of my work almost immediately after making an effort. What can be more inspiring?</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I like to answer to that with a short &quot;I do websites&quot;. But that phrase is just a rabbit hole into all sorts of interesting and challenging problems that I have to deal with every day. I have to look at problems through various users perspectives while understanding clients&#39; needs. I must find a solution within limits of available technology and come up with an approach to solve the problem that will guarantee quality, maintainability, ease of delivery and high speed of development. Finding a solution often involves rapidly learning something new and using that in practice immediately. Building software is a highly diverse challenging task and that is what I love most about it. </p>
<p>Currently I work as a Drupal developer and I am interested in javascript frameworks including nodejs and Angularjs. In 2014 I am also taking on a new role of mentor.</p>
