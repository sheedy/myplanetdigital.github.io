    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>I am a senior technical lead / problem solver with an anything-is-possible can-do attitude. I&#39;m highly flexible in what I do in the day to day operations of Myplanet and am as comfortable in an architect role as I am in a product development and ownership role.  Outside of the office, I&#39;m an avid concert goer that loves seeing smaller shows at any number of Toronto venues.  To relax and to flex creative muscle, I draw and paint.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been working with both open and closed systems to develop web based applications for over a decade. For what its worth, I&#39;m an agile practitioner with scrum certifications, but I&#39;m hardly dogmatic about any one school of thought. Whatever it takes to get it done right.  That might sound like a cop out as an answer but I&#39;m 100% dedicated to the success of the projects I&#39;m involved in.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I am paid to apply critical judgement to complex technical and real world problems.</p>
