    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>Originally from Pakistan, I recently moved to Toronto with my family to work with Myplanet. I have more than 12 years of professional work experience. My journey as an IT professional started back in 1996 when I joined a software engineering degree program. Before joining the program, I had never touched a computer and even after all of these years it still feels like a dream. I started working with PHP in 2004-05. In 2007 I became a ZEND Certified PHP engineer. Outside of Myplanet, I love spending time with my family, doing yoga and going for walks.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>At Myplanet, my primary responsibility is to develop custom web applications using PHP. So far I have had the opportunity to collaborate on different web products using Drupal 7, Magento, Joomla, jquery and angularjs.</p>
