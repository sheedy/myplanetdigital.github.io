    <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>I am a bassist (check out our band &quot;Convoys&quot;!) who enjoys my craft brewery. When I&#39;m not watching Fight Club or the Sound of Music, I am following a range of bands including Death Grips, Grimes and Nirvana.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I have recently switched roles from drupal developer, to curriculum/program developer on Team EDUardo. I am helping to build our 2014 Fellowship program and spearheading the pilot program for World of Webcraft. There&#39;s a lot of new ground to break when it comes to education at Myplanet: exciting times! </p>
<p>Education in any context is a challenging thing do deliver effectively and deliberately, so I find my motivation in the #puglife.</p>
